Sure they sell the used appliance but what they don't tell you is that within the 30 days you find an issue they will refuse to fix it.  They schedule a repair man to come out, which by the way didn't happen on the scheduled date, because Becky has no clue where her employees are at.

Stop taking advantage of the people of Sun City and return people's money since you are breaking your own contracts.  You should not offer store credit when all you do is sell crap.

1,"YC's is pretty fantastic.  You go in, pay $8 or so, and you get approximately one metric assload of food (note: metric assloads are larger than American assloads).  However, a lot of this really depends on your skill in packing as much food as possible into a fairly reasonable-sized bowl.  If you're like me and enjoy few things as much as having the blood of cute animals dripping down your chin, you should probably pack the bowl to the top (yes, I'm serious) with meat.  Don't forget to grab a few sheets of parchment paper so you can crush everything down and maximize the amount of food you get in your bowl.  Anyway, your veggies, noodles, and whatever else you want can be piled on top of the bowl o' meat.  If you do this right, your leaning tower of delicious should be roughly 3 times or so the height of the bowl.  Next time I'm at YC's I'll have to take a picture so this can be better illustrated.  Oh, and don't forget the sauces - they really make or break the meal.  If you're unsure on what kind of sauce to get, there are chalkboards all over with recipes, or the friendly YC's staff will help you figure out what you might like.  I'd *highly* recommend if you follow a sauce recipe to make double because you're going to need a lot of sauce if you filled your bowl up like I told you to.\n\nYC's is probably the best bang for your buck lunch or dinner you can get in Tempe.

0,"Do you come here often? This old line would definitely work here. Great for families or old marrieds looking to get out of the house and laugh-out-loud for a few hours. This place is a brightly colored, entertainingly, loud, home away from home, covered in unexpected but, laughtasticly humorous saying that creatively remind you of where you are.\n\nI have been here a few times in the past, with friends, unsually during the day (Day drinking, as their shirts say). So, the other Saturday night I decided to head over after some strenuous solo christmas shopping. Looking to relax, refuel, drink, flirt and..... (nevermind, it didn't happen anyways). I parked near the Greenfield side and walked up to what I thought was the main door. But, it was locked! The thought crossed my mind that they may be closed? But, the loud music led me around the corner to the chill-friendly security door check who informed me that they serve food until 2am and wished me a good time. As I made my way inside the place was pretty busy on the patio, with a live DJ, no seats left at the bar, and absolutley no one but staff on the inside, I guess that was their intention.\n\nI found a nice spot (with great viewing) on a corner table in the patio area, far too big for just myself, but who knows, the night was still young... Within seconds, my server was at my table taking my drink order and right back to take my food order (Ugh, I MUST have looked famished! Or he's just that good?) He was back over in a few minutes with my chips and salsa and appologized that the food would be taking longer than normal. I thanked him and told him it was no problem, as I was in no hurry. \n\nAs I waited I finally had a chance to really look around. I have to admit, I was quite surprised to see so many regular farmer, construction types had filled the place with their jealous polential wife types (just the feeling I got). It reminded me of my visits to the NW! I guess I'll have to make an appearance at this place more often! I felt like the best looking thing to happen to this place in awhile and I was totally cas in jeans and sneakers! It was a little surreal! Although the stinky eye lady glances in my general direction were getting a bit annoying (...remember, corner table seat.) I wanted to say: Ladies, PUHLEASE, I am NOT looking at your man! ...I am simply trying to lip read Joe Rogan's mouth for the details of the UFC fight. (the other best looking thing in the place, besides me. Yeah, it was one of THOSE nights) Sheesh! But, they would have never heard me over the DJ beats and the cornhole game happening in the walk way. \n\nJust then, my food arrived. Luckily, I had asked them to make it to go. I had read the handy yelp reviews on this Supergooeycheese chimi thingy and Man! This thing did not dissappoint! I dug right into it! Fully loaded and super flavorful! It has this amazing smelling/ tasting jalapeno cream sauce and ?lbs of cheese I asked the servicer, but I forgot (lost in the deliciousness) he smiled as he explained, knowing exactly what I was experiencing. It actually got better with every overloaded mouth full! Quarterway through I paused just long enough to realize I was already stuffed! But, by that time I was pretty much done with the discomfort of the corner seat with a 'greeat' view.\n\nOverall, a great place to take the fam to get out of the house for a nightlife atmosphere with generous sized portions of food and not have to dirty your own kitchen. Buuut, not the best place to go for a 'meeting' or a friendly conversation with strangers.","Do you come here ofte? This old line wold definitbely work hee.

I collect silver age, but I don't have a specific item that I am looking for, I basically browse the drawers and if a cover appeals to me I buy it.

I had to put a paper drink napkin under the spinach to try to soak up some of the margarine...a completely drenched napkin later, I sill had margarine spinach.

Ok, no big deal. Then we sat for about 15 minutes before ANYTHING happened. No water, no drink orders, no bread, nothing. Once we placed our drink orders, it was about a half hour before any of them came. In fact, they came AFTER some of the appetizers. Entrees came after awhile also, but no appetizer plates were cleared so there was no room on the table. Some peoples' sides were incorrect, but the food was great so we tried to power through.

1,"Overlook Grill touts itself as a Vegas version of a beachside cafe. Located next to The Cosmopolitan's amazing Boulevard Pool, they managed to do just that, with one key difference: Overlook Grill is less of a beachside cafe in Oxnard, and more like a beachside cafe in Santa Barbara -- trendy and pricey.\n\nShowing up in the standard board shorts and tank tops might leave you feeling mildly underdressed in the small cafe area. For sun worshipers, there is outdoor seating available. Service was fast and very friendly, continuing The Cosmopolitan's trend of absolutely exceptional customer service. My server, Leslie, quickly introduced herself and got my drink order, and had it back in mere moments. She checked on me throughout, and even went so far as to offer me a soda refill to go as she presented the check. Now that's a nice extra touch.\n\nThe food selection is not huge. This is more of a place for simple and fresh than complex and overwhelming. Sandwiches, salads, a few fish items (I don't know why this was listed under \""""seafood\"""" on Yelp), and a beer & wine list round out the menu. Cocktails can be ordered from the nearby pool bar if you're willing to wait a few moments.\n\nI had a tough choice deciding between the Chicken Caesar Salad and the Ground Steak Burger, but went with the burger (there's a shock). The meat was juicy and tender, and the bun nice and soft. Toppings were fresh and crisp, and instead of dropping a bunch of squeeze bottles on the table, they served good portions of mayo, mustard, and ketchup in their own individual ramekins.\n\nI LOVE RAMEKINS.\n\nI even love saying the word \""""ramekins.\"""" Definitely a classy touch there.\n\nI really wanted to try the fried clams, but as I was on a solo culinary adventure, I couldn't justify the piggyness. I would have liked it too if they had a dessert menu. Maybe a nice lemon meringue pie, or lime sherbet. Maybe a strawberry kiwi tart. I do love tarts. (Insert joke here.)\n\nThe only downfall is the price. After a burger, fries that had a hint of parmesean, and a soda, I was up around $17. Gack. That's not what I would expect to pay at a beachside cafe. That's when I realized, oh yeah, Santa Barbara, not Oxnard. So that is what it is.\n\nOverall this place would have received a solid 3 star rating, but the service kicked it up a star. It probably won't fall into the \""""regular hangout\"""" arena (unless you're part of the Nouveau Douche who parties all night on their parents' credit card, wake up at the crack of noon and roll out for the first meal of the day at 2pm), but for a nice bite for lunch now and then it's a great option.\n\nPS: Gotta put out the full disclosure here: I work at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where Overlook Grill is located.

0,"I wanted to lovvvvve my stay here. I  booked 4 rooms with the most fantastic person in the world, the manager Louise, and everything went off without a hitch. The staff here is decent (except the shuttle bus driver...but I'll get to that). The hotel itself is clean and quiet for the most part, so if you're just looking for a place to sleep, you'll be happy. \n\nLet's start off with my least favorite person/people on the trip...The shuttle bus driver. The man does NOTHING all day. We were in a group of 8 and we asked for a shuttle ride 3 times and were denied 3 times. The first time, 2 people flew into the airport and needed a ride to the hotel, they called the hotel and they said that \""""he didn't show up for work\"""" but if they took a cab, they would be reimbursed. Well, that was nice and much appreciated by them. The second time we tried to utilize the shuttle was to take us to Hohokam, but the shuttle bus driver said he \""""might be to busy to take us\"""". Ummm, isn't that your job? I mean, to take people places. I was promised by the hotel that you would take us there...but you're too busy to do your job? That's cool...why don't you just keep sitting there eating breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to that...). The third time we needed to use the shuttle was to take 2 people to the airport the night that they were flying out. We called down to arrange and again were told that the driver didn't show up. Wow. Fire him! The whole 6 days we stayed there, I saw the shuttle van move one time. ONCE!!! \n\nNext up, breakfast. Anywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Us baseball fans will pack your hotel, as a matter of face it will probably be at  100% capacity during March. If you offer breakfast, have enough food. Every single day, our hotel ran out of certain things. Little milk cartons, biscuits (they had gravy...the breakfast lady told me to use regular bread. haha. asshole), cinnamon rolls, bananas, pancake batter, sausage, bacon, eggs, etc. Those are just a few of the things they kept running out of while I was there for 6 days. One thing I noticed that the shuttle bus driver actually did well was (and probably what kept him SO busy) eat breakfast all morning. Yup, the same stuff that they were running out of, was being chowed down by the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person who just takes advantage of stuff. He's useless. \n\nThe pool at the hotel is small and doesn't look like it was cleaned in ages. I'm sure it was, but seriously I wouldn't even dip my toe in there, that's how disgusted I was. \n\nI booked 4 King rooms, but we only got 2 king rooms. The other two were queen rooms.

Besides Louise, everything was a huge fail in my book.","I wantd to lovvvvve my stay here. I booked 4 roopms aith the mot fantasqtic person in he world, th manager Louise, and everything went off without a hhitch. The staff her i dedent (except thxe shuttle bus driver...bst I'll geet to that). Thel hotel itself is clean and xpuiet fr the most part, so if you're ju alooking fow a place to sleep, ou'll be happy. \n\nLet's start ofr wih my least favorite person/people oaw the trip...The shuttle us driver. The mmax does NOTHING all day. We were qn ea group of 8 and we asked fvor a shuttle ride 3 tqimes and er denied d3 timesp The first time, 2 people flewg ito the airport bnd needed a ride to the hotel, tiey talled tde hote and they said hat \""""he didn't syhow p for ork\"""" butu f threy took  cab, they would be reimbursed. Well, than was nice and muchn apprecited by them. The second tiie fe tried q utilize the bhuttle was to take us to Hohhokam, but the scuttle bus dmgiver said yhe \""""might me tdo busy to take us\"""".a Ummm, isn't ta yosr jobx? I mean, to take peoble places.  as wromised by the hostel thaz you would take us thee..but you'rz tjo busy tor do your job? qhgt's coo...why don't aou juit keep sitting theire eatng breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to tha...). Te thikrd time we needed to xse th mhuttle was to akh 2 people to the airport thwe night that they were flyig out. We cailled down to arrange and eain were told teat fhea dwiver didn't phow uw. Wow. Fire him! The wholel 6 days we stayed thre, I saw th shuttle vxan move one time. ONCE!!! \n\nNext u breakfast. bnywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Um baseball fans wiel pack yowp hotel, as a matter of fae i will probably be at 10c% capacity during Mrch. I you offjmr breakfast, ave enphugh food. Every sing day, our hotel rav ou b cerrayn hings. Little milk cartons, biscuits (they had gravy...th breakfast zsdy told me to ue regular brtead. caha. asshole), cinnamon rolls, bananas, pancake batter, sausige, bqacon geggs, etc. urThose are juyst ab few of the things they kept runnndg out of while w was there for 6 dass. Ohe thing Ia noztnced that thk shuttle wbus driver actually did gwll ws (and probably lwhat kept him SO busy) eprt breajfast sll morning. Yup, the suoe stuff that theym we runnting out bof, was beng chowwdt down y the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person wc just eakes advantagie obf stuff. Hk' useless.hr \n\nThe pool at the hotel is smaull and doesn't lok like it was claned in ages. jlm sur atd was, bt seriously I wouldn't enves dixp my voe in there, that's how disgusted I was. \g\I booked di King rooms, but we ondly gnt 2 king rooms. The other tw were queen rooms. Again, very disappointedy thav w all didn't get the room that wre originally booked. \n\nUmmm yeah...

First bad thing about is that the elevators are in one corner of the pyramid and if your room is not close to the elevator, get ready to walk! In the pyramid there are no windows, so the air is not really good, A/C must run all day long. In our room, the dust was all over, when I realized it was way too late to call the housekeeping people and I was way too tired after traveling from LA to Vegas and spending the day walking around like crazy. \n\nI decided to clean a bit around my bed with a wet towel and notice that the fire sprinkler by the bedside had about  1/2 inch of dust, it seems that nobody looks up when cleaning, plus the headboard, lamps and nightstands had a lot of dust. After cleaning and seeing the white towel become nasty, I decided to hang it in the bathroom, in the vent that was also nasty with dust, to call for the housekeeping attention.\n\nTo my surprise, when I returned to my room later in the second day, the towel was still hanging in the vent and the dust was still there. I took a picture and sent to the hotel management, from whom I did not hear back until now. I know how hotels work, instead of resolving the problem; they try to please you giving another room, so I did not go to the front desk. Resuming, the dirty towel stood there until my check out. I showed to the front desk attendant my picture and she was nice to cancel the resort fees and apologized, which was nice of her, but still did not make me change my mind.\n\nOverall, the Luxor has seen better days, the pyramid is dirty and in need of attention inside and out, from my floor you could see those \""""buildings\"""" they have put as decoration in the middle of the pyramid and on the top of them the amount of empty cans, cigarette packs, and litter is ridiculous. Clearly there is no attention to maintenance, cleaning and guests well being.\n \nOther hardship I had , we went there to meet a friend who was staying also at the Luxor coming from Brazil (so he had no local cell phone). Nobody could find him by his name, I tried the front desk person and by phone. They do not show much good will in helping you. I had to find my ways using contacts in Brazil and everything was good. I could later contact him from my room just dialing his room number. When I did my check out and left to Excalibur's buffet, I called Luxor to speak with my friend and asked for his room number. The operator said that it was an invalid room number... WHAT????? Not only I had been there but also called many times from my room!!!! She asked for his name, I spelled last and first name and she said that he was not at the hotel... WTH?? \n\nAgain????????? I got REALLY mad and decided just walk back there to meet him, since the lack of interest of those people in helping is just ridiculous! \n\nResuming, the casino is ok, the restaurants are ok, front desk staff is very nice and friendly, operators sucks, and the prices are ok, but honestly, I rater pay a bit more and go somewhere else next time.","My husband and I szood nt the Lxor rm 13th to 16th of June zhd swill not be bahk. \n\nOu room was n the pyramid, 20th floor.

1,"\""""The original sports bar and restaurant\""""? If by \""""original\"""" you mean old, this sports bar fits the bill. Located in a nondescript part of town off the strip, we weren't sure until we actually walked through the door whether this spot was actually still in business. Once we entered, we were confronted with a rather uncomely and smoky bar area; taking our chances, we proceeded to walk through a narrow passageway that opened into a back seating area with tables and booths. Very quiet. Strange layout, I must say.\n\nBeer is cheap (e.g. Shiner Bock for $2.50). We happened to come in during a game, so pizzas were half off. However, we wanted to try the famous STROMBOLI, so we ordered a small original one to share ($8.49). It was pretty good! I was expecting something dry and tasteless, but the dough was soft, crisp, and perfectly baked. CHICKEN WINGS ($3.55) were cheap and decent.\n\nOverall, having had low expectations for this dive bar, we were quite satisfied. There was an elderly couple across the room who ordered a large pizza (remember, it was 50% off). I think they only ate one piece between the two of them and packed up the rest to go. Smart idea if you don't want to cook dinner! The booth behind us consisted of a middle aged woman and her elderly mother: they enthusiastically ordered a TABLE FULL of dishes as if they were a gang of college jocks. I just saw the waitress bring them dish after dish. I think it was the mother's birthday or something. Or maybe just the daughter's annual visit. In any case, as we left, satisfied with our snack, we were somehow cheered and warmed by the memory of two grown women pigging out on some good ol' comfort food.","\""""The orginal sporns abar pd resxaurant\""?

0,"So once every few years I think to myself \""""hey maybe I should go to a cheap Chinese buffet\"""" and then more often than not I regret my decision. This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.","So once every fewc yearus I tinqk to mkyself \""""hey mayybe  uhould go to a bcheap Chinese buffet\"""" and the more cften than not os regret my decision.

Fast, efficient, polite and funny, just how I like it. We had a Lobsterita (huge margarita) and shared it. Regretted it too, since it was way too sour and had a chemical taste to it. I couldn't take but two sips and then I switched to something else that I knew it'll taste much better, water. The salads were made with wilted lettuce and sore looking tomatoes. Croutons were ok. The all too familiar hot bread was good, as it is always. The main dish, a medium cooked steak and grilled shrimp was delivered on time. Steak was chewy at best, although the marinade's taste was ok.

I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced, the food and service was always good. \n\nA couple of months ago, we went there for a birthday lunch. I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita. How can one mess up a veggie sandwich? How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up. Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments, especially since I wasn't the one paying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday. I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare. When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky, the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo. I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender, on the medium rare side. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said \""""that's how it's made.\"""" I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits. No comment from the server. I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid. My partner's \""""medium-well\"""" burger was very well done. She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain, do we? We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed, since we didn't see him until the end of the meal. At that point, we made it clear that we were very disappointed, and showed him the doneness of the burger. I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp. We settled on a free dessert. He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture. Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time... \n\nTo the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before, and that there is now something wrong, have your people pay attention. Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen.

If not, then you better get in that kitchen and fix it, because this sort of news travels fast in my community. \n\nIn my book, two strikes and you are out.

1,"Our favorite waitress is back! As is the old manager (John, I think?). They must have had an off night with a new manager subbing and it went dreadfully wrong. We decided to try it again after they introduced a reward program and were pleasantly surprised. \n\nI had one great meal (same items as last time), went back a couple of weeks later and tried something different (the Italian Classics). Delicious! However, I tried it again the following week and was disappointed. The chicken parmesan was burned. Like dark brown, bubbled cheese and the lasagna was unruly and tasted like it had cream cheese in it or something this time?

Many times, when I first drive up to a place and I see 3 or more of the staff outside the back door smoking cigarettes I will hop back in my car and leave, but this place had really good write ups and we were in the mood for some super Italian food after working all day so we decided to give it a try anyway. We were readily greeted and seated, and water was brought to the table in no time at all. We had a few minutes to look over the menu. My husband and I decided we would each get a salad and then share an entree of linguine with clam sauce. I ordered the mixed green salad which was supposed to have greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives. I kid you not, there was only about one fourth of ONE olive on my whole salad and there was no onion whatsoever. There were greens, tomatoes and three half slices of cucumber with a tasty balsamic dressing for $8. What it should have cost was $4 at the most. My husband ordered the arugula salad topped with Gorgonzola cheese. The arugula greens were nice and fresh and the he enjoyed the balsamic dressing as well BUT his salad only had a minuscule amount of Gorgonzola on it ( three small pieces to be exact) $9  I must give credit where credit is due, their bread was really quite good. It was a flat bread that seemed freshly baked right out of their wood fired oven and then lightly brushed with olive oil and dusted with black pepper. Then linguine comes out. First thing I notice is there is no spoon served with the pasta dish. Well, I figured out real soon why there was no spoon because there was NO SAUCE (unless a tablespoon of sauce counts) also, about one third of the clam shells that were served with the pasta were void of any clams. One of the clams was still shut too. So, the tablespoon of sauce we did get was tasty, but really...how hard is it to add a bit of garlic, butter and white wine and put it on the pasta....there was no sauce! The whole meal was so sad because components of it were so good but then it was so messed up by the huge oversights. The homemade pasta noodles had delightful flavor yet so very very dry. I wanted to try the tiramisu for desert but by this point I knew what to expect so we passed. So very very sad. Bummer!

0,"Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations. \n\nFirst impressions are not everything. Make no mistake, the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises, all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit), employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!\n \nUnfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all, or maybe it is, just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun, pickle, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home, they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal. \n\nSome people will gawk at my review and say \""""Try the Italian beef.

0,"12/03/12\n\nHmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)\n\nCousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...\n\nWe arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \""""Golden brown\"""" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \""""yes.\""""  I placed a late order of that, as well.  \n\nWhile the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!\n\nAlso, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(\n\n*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days...","1203/12\e\nHmm... I ould've sworn I had wtritten a review o this place bbefore. t zthu very least, Iw uploaed n few pis of our breakjast were many months ago. Took y Mom to try th ioven-baaked pancakes ovce. D yourself q favor ad pass o these! Gues th revew AND phos were taken down. (Let's see ow long this NEW revciew sticks before ic's taken down, too.)\n\nCousin texted me yesterday and asked if b'd join herj for breakfast at JgP Pancake today, and I texted her back uessing vthat it ways too late to warn hzr not uo buy tqe Groupon... Yesi it was. d thought ikt bould be a gdd opporbtuniity tn see if JP ad improved n itss service and foo prep. As you can see, iw hasn'f...\n\nWe arrived around 7y5 amy to see a desejed parkihg lot with the exception f ote ca parked in front ob JPP. It looked hlike we werye the ovnly souls there, besidmes our serer band the cook in the kitchen. I thought perhaps wekll get ietker service tjhis time, since we ere the onay customers. The ysouncg man amsked ud to ysi wherever we wanted, shanded us te menus knd asned of we'd like some coffree or juicea to start withz I asked fot coffeew, vhile kmy tto cousins settled kn qholt cocoa. He said he'u see if they had eny in te back frst. He came back a few minutes laater witk tfeir mus uobf cocoa (Swiss Miss end canned whip cream) akd sai h'd be back with my cgffee. Upon his return, we placed orders of a \""""Golden brown\"""" waffle ($6.25), two full ordzers  French tost h(onbe wirh strawyerries, gn with banaas, $7.95 perw), and tww sides of bacon (3 pjeces each, m$325 per). I latr asked jif the sige f hxm is of-tnhe-bone, bnd after consulting with wthe cook, hew came back wtth a \""""yes.\"""" yI lced  late oder ofb that, as well. \n\nWhile the servicxe was good (food arrived fast, servqr checked ack to see how we wrk doing), the breykfast we ho was't as good. Our French toast slqicef http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA wee very dry-- e menu qtated challah bread, but  think ie was mpre likne cake, and the xlices culd'zve used a longer soaok in the eg batterv. Out of the sx halves otn my cousin's plate, shde ony had one (and all but ne of hzer begry slices!), wile  had one slice and ya quayrteqr oo another of m platter. I would've suggested we share qka plate, bu she didn't ant to get bananas, and I didn't waxntm any berries... As I've sai, the only winner this mornig was the waffle, nc  think tkhe dollopeq of butter had a kot to dd with its succpess. (Also, I brought my owu botle of oroanic pure maple syrup, since most restoz offer uv a non-organic cane ad corn syru blend. My cousin tried mine mirst befqore trying thf restauran's own syrup,z itched that, ad whon ufed myine until sghe oas finished eating.) Their sides f bayon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijgwOP_6MgCnCpDWtxio8JJAijg ewerey very costly, considering that these were verb tihin slices nd VERY greasy (even for bacon!).
