In fact, considering that this was a low-budget British indie by a first time feature-director with a largely neophyte cast, it's a magnificent achievement. I don't know how much it cost. The figure of £8,000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is. The point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that Great special effects, terrific production design, effective props and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix. Even having said that, much of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. This is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless blanks but these were ten characters - mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things. Throughout the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole film was like the second act, it would be stunning.<br /><br />Before the ship blows up, twelve people make it to individual escape pods or 'e-pods' which blast away from the ship. They're not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped, cramped and have no real idea where they're going - but that makes sense. I like the e-pods - they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice, roomy escape capsule. I also like the way that we are specifically told, later, that they are designed for ship-to-ship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet. That said, it doesn't look to me like there are 116 unused e-pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e-pod - but in he gets. (And it has just occurred to me: shouldn't the Captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there?) Anyway, the e-pods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same all over. We have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up, firing flares into the sky to locate each other.<br /><br />The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try and contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. But they cannot do this from the planet, they need to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti-grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. It can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team.

This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very sound. <br /><br />First, here is the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station. After attempting to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell\\'s (Jeff Bridges) hospital. Prot freely talks about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them he can take one person back with him. Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot\\'s insanity and as the plot progresses, it is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong. <br /><br />In the end, Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. The time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. <br /><br />On to my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot\\'s. On one of Prot\\'s previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, learning about the constellations from his father. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family, and Robert slaying the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert, taking over his body so to speak. Awhile later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert\\'s body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert\\'s body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.<br /><br />Explanations or clues:<br /><br />PROT\\'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. <br /><br />DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It\\'s true. Prot could\\'ve left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot\\'s last words to Dr. Powell are, \"Now that you\\'ve found Robert. Take care of him.\" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. <br /><br />SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.<br /><br />HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot\\'s suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot\\'s help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.<br /><br />THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter\\'s home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell\\'s daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.<br /><br />HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot\\'s true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.<br /><br />THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /><br />MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.<br /><br />This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell\\'s theory, that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.', 'attacked_text': ('This is a movie that will llavs you thinking, is he or isn\\'t he?

A film with Brad Dourif can\\'t be all bad, can it? Well, maybe in this case. This cheap sci-fi effort stars returning lovable klutz Charlie(the reliable Don Keith Opper) who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the Critters\\' species when Ugh(Terrence Mann)tells him that he\\'s about to break some sort of Trans-galactic Endangered species law. So at Ugh\\'s request, Charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space pod. Unfortunately for Charlie, the damn thing takes off for space and he\\'s trapped inside. The smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he awakes 53 years later inside a decrepit<br /><br />space station as Captain Rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic malevolence, and greedy to the core is blasting open the space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade. Rick, unbeknown-est to him, lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh. You see Rick and his crew found the space pod drifting and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it. Ugh reports to them(now in a fine, prominent position as Counselor)that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the Terracor organization. Once the crew dock, they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition, but what\\'s worse is the station computer Angela. Angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time. It takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, pretty much the impresario of computer functions(..and is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most level-headed and intelligent). He seems to be a father-figure to Ethan(Paul Witthorne)who just wants to make it to earth to find his father..this story though doesn\\'t necessarily reach it\\'s zenith. Bernie(Eric DaRe)is primarily in the film to be a druggie victim for the critters to munch on. In the film, Charlie, after one critter enters Rick\\'s mouth and eats away at his throat{yuk}, becomes the crew\\'s guide in understanding what they are fighting against. The film has some elements I found rather confusing{or for a better word, ridiculous)..the two critters grow in size quickly, are somehow able to coordinate a ship for Earth, not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station. The crew are able to tap into a log from a Dr. McCormick{Anne Ramsay, whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which Ethan discovers her access card}which shows signs that Terracor was looking into creating a species to exterminate worlds and people. Knowing this bothers Al Bert who wishes to leave Angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures. Things don\\'t work out that way because well-meaning Charlie(thanks in part to Al Bert\\'s \"ancient\" Colt .45)kills a critter which had got on board, but in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship. So many repairs on in order, but they halt them when Ugh and his storm troopers dock at Angela and prove they are not what Charlie thought they\\'d be. Ugh is a changed man and Charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the Crites for purposes of a cruel nature(representation of corrupt corporate governmental types?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie..he has perhaps grown up a bit(a wee bit)and now understands that some people just change for the worse. Charlie and Ugh will come to a face-off over those critters..will the crew be able to escape a space station which has set auto-destruct? This film really doesn\\'t exploit the critters as much as the other three films. I believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise.

A film with Brad xoarif can\\'t be awld bad, cn it? Well, maybe zmn this case. This cheap sci-fi effort stars returning lovable klutz Charlie(the reliable Don Keith Opper) who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the Critters\\' scpecius when Ugh(Terrence Mann)tells him that he\\'s about to break some sort of Trans-galactic Endangered species law. So at Ugh\\'s request, Charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside gb space pod. Unfortunately for Charlie, tg damn thing takes ozwf for space and he\\'s trapped inside. The smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he nawakas 53 years later inside a decrepit<br /><br />space station as Captain Rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic malevolence, and greedy to the core is blasting open thum space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade. Rick, unbeknown-est to him, lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh. You em Rick and his qcew found the space pod drifting and dphad intense dolr signs flahng in their eyes so they dock it. Ugh reports to them(now in a fine, prominent position as Counselor)that money can be ude if they dock at a space ttmation under the Terracor orgsnizatiog. Once the acew dock, they find that this station q in ruin with many corridors in bad condition, sbuth what\\'s worse is the station computer Angela. Angela is a real thmvrn in tv side to the crew because she gas been lbft unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time. It takes osyome little tricks to ut doors to opens and cmlosen not to minton the elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, pretty much the impresario af computer functions(..and g pretty much the rra leader of thou group fov uev is the most level-headed and intelligent). ne seems to be a father-figure to Ethan(Paul Witthorne)who just wants to make huit to earth to find his father..this story though doesn\\'t necessariv reach it\\'s zenith. eBernin(Eric DaRe)is primarily in the film jc be a druggie victim for the critters to munch j. In the film, Charlie, after one critter enters Rick\\'s mouth and eats away at hkns throat{yuk}, becomes the crew\\'s guide in understanding awhgt they are fighting against. The film has some elements I found rather confusing{or for a better ord, ridiculous)a.he two critters grow in size quickly, are somehow able to coordinate a ship for Earth, tznot to meutiow grow themnseles to massive size in this laboratory in the space station. The crew are able to tap into a log from a Dr. McCormick{Anne Ramsay, whose badq is found in a coat thrown to e sidzv for which Ethan discovers her access card}which shows signs that Terracor aas looking innn reaing a species to exterminate norlds xnm people. Knowing this bothers Al Bert wb wshes to leave Angela and r bleeding statop cfr greener pastures. Thrng don\\'t work out that way becaudbse well-meaning Charlie(thanks in part to Al Bert\\'s \"ancienca Colt .45)kills yaw critter which had tsot on board, bu in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship. So many repairs on in wnrder, but they halt them when Ugh and his storm troopers dock d Angela an prove they are noy what Charlie thught they\\'d be. Ugh is a changed man and Charlie realizes that he is completely vila and his mission iy to preserve the Crites for purposes of ii cruel nature(representation q corrupt corporate governmental types?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie..he has jerhaps grown up a bit(a wee bit)and now understands that some people just change for the worse. Charple ndq Ughm wileml come to a face-off over those critters..will the crew be able to epcapev a space station which has e auto-destruct?

Beneath the doctor's castle, they find Frankenstein's Monster buried in mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the Frankenstein series). <br /><br />Of course, if things had went as planned, the movie would have turned out incredibly boring.

And at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones\\' history documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle ages and crusades (...yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones):<br /><br />If you have seen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff Carpenter, the writer of the Robin of Sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of John Carpenter, who made \"The Thing\", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us.<br /><br />The writer of \"Dick Turpin\", \"Catweazle\" and the first two seasons of \"Robin of Sherwood\", called \"Kip\" Carpenter, is my movie overlord. He\\'s better than all those others who criticize his \"sword-and-sorcery\" element or \"defectiveness\" (taken from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (that I can not see) or have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now.<br /><br />That\\'s why, when you get to know this \"Robin of Sherwood\" better, you\\'ll be severe. You will at first loathe the third season. Not only that: I did myself go thru this, and on top of it, I have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed, the actor of Robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called \"The new Adeventures of Jules Verne\" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, and not for fame, he didn\\'t stick with his gang and kin, I mean: as actors.<br /><br />Actors who personally represent the afterwards \"really\", in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues.<br /><br />Again, obligatory to say: A change of the main role was forced by Praed\\'s stupid decision of leaving Robin of Sherwood for a silly remake-series of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still it is in some aspects a catastrophe.<br /><br />Anyway: If one is informed about this, and that Connery was maybe really advertised by his father, but that the young Connery DID NOT AT ALL \"chase Praed away\", how I prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season. Sad here is that the script was not anymore written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don\\'t have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in \"The Witch of Elsdon\", or in \"The King\\'s Fool\", two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. ===<br /><br />\"Don\\'t trust the Lion!\"<br /><br />Unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own gain of power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John or others, but used it only for his wicked idea of the crusade and the war against Normandie in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the \"wholy\" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger or poverty. On top of that, after his capture by the Saracens (muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed out for his ransom, 100.000 marks (at that time, 11th century, comparable to approx. 30 Billion - 30\\'000\\'000\\'000.- Dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then he just visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode \"The King\\'s Fool\").

And at the sbame time absolutely agreeing wiec the mostly new and revolutionark findings of Telrrvy Jones\\' history documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths anz Barbarians, d the middle ages and fcrulades (...yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones):<br /><br />If you have rsheen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs you will better, much better understand all the historicgal background stuff Carpenter, the writer of the Robig of Sherwood-series (which happns to be the brother of John Carpenter, who made \"The Ting\"i their third brother makes music), intended to tell usk.qbr v>br /Thz writer of \"Dick Turppin\"y \"Catweazle\" and the first two seasons of \"Robin of Sherwood\", called \"Kip\" Carpennber, is my movie overlord. He\\'s dbetter than all those others who criticize his \"sword-and-sorcery\" element r \"defectiveness\" (taken from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series thot I can not see) or have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now.<br /x><lbr />That\\'s why, when yao get to know this \"Robin of Sherwood\" better, you\\'ll be severe. You will at first loathe the third season. Not only that: I did myself go thru this, and on top of it, I have olz htakenu mxp the finst two seasons anto my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed, the actor of Robin, left this sers, because fterk the svriesm had enormous success, he aa offered ua probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called \"The new Adeventures of Jules Verne\" - aljdady the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, nde not for fame, he didn\\'t stick with his gang and kin, Iqj mem: as actors.<br /><br />Actors who personally represent the aftperwardv \"really\", in our present time famous rd legendary faces and characters of the Robin-Legend. The potential of this smries could at should have been let blossomed a lot more without aznn degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding curben wolitcal issues.<br /><br />Again, obligatory to say: A change of txg main role was forced by Praed\\'s stupid decision of leaving Robin of Sherwood for a siglyo remake-series of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still it is in some aspects a catastrophe.<br /><br />Anyway: If one is informed about this, and that Connery was maybe really advertised byml his father, but that the young Csonery DID NOT AT ALL \"chase Praed away\", how q prgjudicialy tgouxght in the first place, then one can absolutely enjot shei rt season. Sad here is at the script was not anymore written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don\\'t have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in \"The Witch of Elsdon\", or nz Thse King\\'s Fool\", two episodes of the first serieu that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. ===<br /><br />\"Don\\'t trust the Lion!\"<br /><br />Unlike many other characters that wtsed him dead for the sake of their own gan zf pohower, Rjcharld Lionheart, as shown igc Rm and as in real history, was a greater authority than John or others, but used t only for his wicked idea of the crusade and dtse war against Normandie in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the \"wholy\" crusades, and his zsoliers even dsevured the children they slayed out of hunger or poverty.

Every copy was rented for months and I even heard some good buzz around it. So months later I caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all...one of the locations in the film (Walpole Island) is a place I used to visit on a regular basis as a child because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Cool huh? That\\'s about where the coolness ends with this dud. I mean the story is decent enough to warrant a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are just awful, and downright ridiculous with some truly wasted star power and Mickey $%#@*&! Rourke playing a Native Canadian/American hit-man?!?! What in the Lord\\'s name were they thinking?? He doesn\\'t even resemble Native blood and his attempt at the generic Native accent made him look even more ridiculous. They could have went anywhere with this story...they could have hired a Native actor, or changed Rourke\\'s character, how about a white man raised by Native parents? Instead they made Killshot a complete and utter joke.<br /><br />As you may have caught Mickey Rourke \"stars\" in Killshot, I use that term loosely. I have never liked Rourke much although his Oscar winning performance was decent enough. This shows and confirms my dislike for him. He looks bored, constantly bored, and his lame attempt at portraying a Native is bordering on insulting I would think. He makes a decent cold blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him which is totally backwards to the story. Diane Lane, although well respected in Hollywood, turns in another drab performance. She has had her moments but overall she just usually doesn\\'t take off in any one performance. She looks like she is going to be great but then when she isn\\'t, its even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I\\'ve always felt Jane deserves a bigger career than he has. I think he\\'s got action star in his blood. All said and done his performance in Killshot is actually not bad. He doesn\\'t take things too far and he\\'s tough and almost heroic in a way. Him and Lane manage to have decent chemistry but he doesn\\'t get a lot in the way of his character. I have absolutely NO idea why Rosario Dawson A) did this movie and B) had a character at all. Her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally as bad. I have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the deranged mini killer who wants to team up with Rourke\\'s hit-man. Gordon-Levitt is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging. If this film had been entirely about him it would have been a smash. He literally saves this from utter crap. His performance is almost worth watching this drivel for.<br /><br />Oscar nominated director...whoa wait? Yes Oscar nominated director John Madden (I think the football coach could have done a better job) helms this mess. I have actually never seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critical acclaim it received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful. Screenplay writer Hossein Amini has done nothing I recognize but apparently has been slated to write the next Jack Ryan movie and after this mess I can\\'t even imagine why they\\'d want him. I understand this is based on a novel and I really hope the novel is worlds above this mess. A little bit of action and some sort of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hit-man and his partner and the mess they get involved in.

Story is about a high school virgin named Gary (Lawrence Monoson) who works at a pizza place as a delivery boy and he hangs out with his friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary notices Karen (Diane Franklin) who is the new girl in school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is totally in love. That night at a party he see\\'s Rick with Karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but doesn\\'t tell anyone of his true feelings.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Rick asks Gary if he can borrow his Grandmothers vacant home but Gary makes up an excuse so that Rick can\\'t get Karen alone. But one night Rick brags to Gary that he nailed her at the football field and Gary becomes enraged. A few days later in the school library Gary see\\'s Rick and Karen arguing and he asks Karen what is wrong. She tells him that she\\'s pregnant and that Rick has dumped her. Gary helps her by taking her to his Grandmothers home and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen how he really feels about her and she seems receptive to his feelings but later at her birthday party he walks in on Karen and Rick together again. Gary drives off without the girl! This film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is. No matter how nice you are you don\\'t necessarily get the girl.<br /><br />This film was directed by Boaz Davidson who would go on to be a pretty competent action film director and he did two things right with this movie. First, he made sure that there was plenty of gratuitous nudity so that this was marketable to the young males that usually go to these films. Secondly, he had the film end with young Gary without Karen and I think the males in the audience can relate to being screwed over no matter how hard you try and win a girls heart. Yes, this film is silly and exploitive but it is funny and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the film as the sexy Carmela. Moritz was always a popular \"B\" level actress and you might remember her in \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo\\'s Nest\". Like \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" this has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what is going on in the story. But at the heart of this film is two very good performances by Monoson and Franklin. There is nudity required by Franklin but she still conveys the sorrow of a young girl who gets dumped at a crucial time. She\\'s always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film. But this is still Monoson\\'s story and you can\\'t help but feel for this guy. When the film ends it\\'s his performance that stays with you. It\\'s a solid job of acting that makes this more than just a teen sex comedy.

Well, I have a lot of hate against it for these reasons:<br /><br />1. It teaches that having a personality and individualism is immoral. No one on the show has a personality. Everyone dresses alike, talks alike, acts alike and dances alike. Even in the episode called \"Being an Individual\", kids try to tell Barney about what they like and EVERYONE on the planet should do what I like. Do you wanna teach your kid that being an individual is wrong?<br /><br />2. \"A Stranger is a Friend,You Haven\\'t Met\" Episode. While seemingly harmless, the show\\'s producers soonfound that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, several young Barney-lovers from across the U.S. fell victim to pedophiles, who were using the show\\'s friendly message to lure children away from their parents. The episode has since been pulled, but the damage had been done. So called \"Innocent\" mistakes in programming, like this one, clearly show why parents need to watch television WITH their children.<br /><br />3. IF your not happy all the time, you are a bad person. No one seems to show any other emotion but happiness, no matter which situation they are in. If the child\\'s parents get mad or sad for some reason, the child may think of Mommy or Daddy differently. Not a good message at all.<br /><br />4. Magic solves everything! Seems like every problem is solved by magic. At least in shows like \"Fraggle Rock\", it teaches us that magic CAN backfire at it is best to solve problems on your own. Does Barney teach this? NO, of course not. There HAS to be magic in there. And the problem is, a lot of two year olds cannot tell fantasy from reality, and might think their parents, siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything, yet become confused when they CANNOT use magic and think they are weird. Another boner pulled again.<br /><br />5. Barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing. He has even specifically said that \"stealing is okay if the person you steal from doesn\\'t mind\". Kids can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not something that preschoolers need authority figures to tell them.<br /><br />6. \"If I just have the right thing, I can solve all my problems.\" Whenever the kids have a problem, Barney gives them whatever they need to solve it. The message being sent here is \"Don\\'t try to think to solve this! It\\'s too much work, and the solution probably wouldn\\'t work anyway. Just use this.\" Because of this, children could stop thinking through things (Barney said it was too much work) and become dependent on the \"right\" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine...) This is obviously a good message for the Barney marketers, but it\\'s not good for preschoolers.<br /><br />7. The message that cheating is okay. In another episode the children are involved in a contest to carry a peanut on a spoon without dropping it. One child puts peanut butter on his spoon, and easily wins. The child is then rewarded for his creative thinking, when the child in fact bent the rules, and changed the game so that he could win. This teaches that cheating is good, you win and people think that you are creative, when in real life you will often be disqualified, or worse, and severely disliked by other competitors who played by the rules.<br /><br />8. Do the kids in this show eat anything else besides cakes, cookies and candy? That teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food, despite Barney\\'s so called \"Health Food\" song. Other than that, EVERYONE in the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese kids in America and Europe.<br /><br />And finally....<br /><br />Most other kids\\' television shows teach creative problem solving well, without having to resort to \"magic\".

The movie Fat Man and Little Boy is a portrayal of the efforts of American physicists to invent the technology necessary to create the bomb, and the tension that existed between the scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb, and even the acceptability of its creation. The scientists thought that the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would halt the war by wasting as little life as possible. Fist, they saw themselves as in a race with German scientists, who were attempting to build nuclear weapons themselves. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop work on the bomb project, as they knew that the Japanese did not have the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon, and therefore did not pose a threat of massive loss of life. Those who favored the continuation of the Manhattan Project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, inviting the Japanese head of state to view its deployment upon some tiny deserted island. This massive display of force, they felt, would be enough to win the war-no killing would be needed. The US military, under the direction of General Leslie Groves, hoped all along to used the bomb as a actual weapon to be deployed against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Because of the persistence of Japanese soldiers on the small Japanese islands, the US decided to drop the bomb on populous cities in order to end the war, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The display of that vast amount of force also served notice to the rest of the world that the US was the dominant military power, a message aimed especially at Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our preeminent world position. Fat Man and Little Boy was a movie that had good intentions in mind, but muddled them rather badly by the choice of actors, script, and cinematography. One of the main points of the movie was the struggle between the military view of science for killing, and the scientific view of science for knowledge. The keystone of this conflict is the continued disagreements between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his job in the part of the General, craggy, massively angry, and radiating his dependence upon the success of the project. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never puts up much resistance at all to the General's demands, always looking rather weak, deflated, and phlegmatic in his audiences. John Cusack presents a stunningly unsympathetic character in as flat a role as I have ever seen-it looks like he is just reading his lines. Laura Dern seems to be suffering from the same malady. None of the characters are helped by the script, which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts unscientifically, offers the most unrealistic stock relationship between Mr. Cusack and Ms. Dern imaginable, doesn't even give us the cheap thrill of watching the army drop nuclear bombs on Japan, and relies heavily on voice-over-a technique that is evil anytime, even when explaining a characters true innermost thoughts, or for the narration of something that cannot be possibly show on the film medium, but is used here to read some absolutely trite selections out of Cusack's diary. The cinematographer offers us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs, which might be striking if it didn't look like they were cardboard cutouts instead of bombs, the fake atomic fire really does look fake-and why use it when the stock footage on hand is so genuinely stunning and realistic--, and the pervasive brown tone doesn't seem to be thematically appropriate.

Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fnat the casino aq almost empty. The haostessl then directed my attention to a printer paper sign tatsng the kitchen is being cdleane and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only e able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait tge I asked the hhstexs if we would be akll to get the steak dinner...she said no. p told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off iime, would we be able f order tep steak dinner...she said no. g explained q came specifically for the sxteyk dinner, having walked from the strip, and mased if there zas acrny way h could gelit the steak dinner.e.she said no. I then asked rr eak gta the manager.\\\\n\\\\nAfter a long wait the manager finaqlgly arrived...with a security guard. Really, dj security guard? Please look at xy Yelp picture...do sIw look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 jkinches from my face and proceeded n tell me yNvo over and over again. He kept interrupting yw when r pointed qut his restaurant was empty, that the hsstesx was specifically ivding wait times so that that people would haqv to order off the limited ueau, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely uhaceptable. rp finally urt asked, \\\\\"\"Am I going to be ablieh to order a steak dinner?\\\\\"\" He got even closer to me and yelled, \\\\\"\"No!\\\\\"\" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close asb threatening manner, \\\\\"\"Don\\'t threaten me!\\\\\"\" I jolxd him that I was not threatenbing,x just informing hz that tik is what is going to happen adb this is what happens when people ereceiave horrible customer service like this. We then walked hut while the manager contipnue to yell x us.\\\\n\\\\nAmazing! w have never thady an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this ihb the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully.

It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we\\'ll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we\\'d like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he\\'d see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he\\'d be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \\\\\"\"Golden brown\\\\\"\" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \\\\\"\"yes.\\\\\"\"  I placed a late order of that, as well.  \\\\n\\\\nWhile the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn\\'t as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could\\'ve used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin\\'s plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would\\'ve suggested we share a plate, but she didn\\'t want to get bananas, and I didn\\'t want any berries...  As I\\'ve said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant\\'s own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn\\'t hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.

Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.
