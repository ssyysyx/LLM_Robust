0,0,negative,negative,"We signed up for sprint a few months ago. The map they showed us said we would have good reception at our house. Not true. Crappy to no reception. Sprint finally sent us a booster so we could get phone service. Still does not work. Talked to sprint several times. We were to get a call back from retention about disconnecting but never got it. For $340.00 per phone, 3 phones, we could disconnect even though they are at fault for lying about the coverage we would have. if you are thinking about getting sprint, DON'T. It would be a HUGE mistake. I tell everyone I meet to stay clear of the worst cell phone service in Las Vegas.","Wk igned p of stjinp a feh xoths gao ehT pm tcye shopd su sai l euld rve oogd receplin ta oup heue. os tre. trapp b on receptizn Sprikt filaoly stn s a bodster o w ohuld eg ehne esrvice.

1,0,negative,negative,"Looking foward to our guys night out at Fogo. Found the staff to  pompous and rude. Went to go sit down and asked about their corkage fee it was $45 per bottle. When we asked to speak to a manager to see if this is true, due to the large amount that was quoted , we were met with a rude reply. So the six of us just got up and went next door. Their neighbor was more than happy to accommodate us in only charge us $15 for a corkage fee. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind paying a little more for corkage fee at a nice restaurant, but really it's just a glorified buffet. The sad part is we probably would have dropped about $600 that night.

Lupe the hostess was so nice and told us everything about the menu and even gave advice about where to watch the Bronco game while in town. \nNow about the food, Orange juice was big enough to serve 3 people and at iHop this would have been 12 - 15 $$$. The portions are big enough to share and they will let you replace pancakes for toast and biscuits and gravy etc.. Anything we asked for was perfectly fine with them and made quick work of it. If you live here or are in town, stop at this pace because it's worth it! It's not fancy so if your looking for 5 star hotel food with oatmeal at $14 bucks a bowl, this is not your place.

After my friends kept making a big deal about it, I decided to try it on a Monday night. Upon arriving, I was surprised at how many people were there, standing in line at 11 pm. Despite the long lines, the service was quick, prompt, and ran in a very strategic way.\n\nMy first visit there, I decided to try 2 adobada tacos with everything on them. Upon eating my first taco, I couldn't stop myself from shoving the second one in my mouth and getting back in line for more tacos. It was so tasty and flavorful! The sauces mixed so well with the juicy meat, and complemented each other perfectly. My second round I decided to try the carne asada tacos which also drove my taste buds wild. Everything tasted and actually was fresh! The meat and tortillas are made right in front of you, how can it get any better than that? \n\nTacos El Gordo is one of the best taco places here in Vegas.

14,1,positive,positive,"HOW CAN I FORGET TO REVIEW XS LAS VEGAS OH MY GOD.\n\nI went to Vegas back in August of this year and it was absolutely the best time of my life! My friends and I went to XS on a Monday night for \""""Dim Mak\"""" Mondays to see of course, the one and only Steve Aoki! It was hands down, the best time in a nightclub I had in awhile. I'm from NYC and saying this means A LOT. You know NYC has a lot of great clubs and such but nothing, NOTHING compared to XS. We had free champagne thanks to Aoki's performance and of course some free cake! (Aoki fans know what I'm talking about!) \n\nAdmission for ladies was free of course, especially if you know a promoter. The ratio thing is a really big deal, and I don't blame promoters for asking for a lot of girls because a room full of dudes could get kinda weird. My guy friends paid $20 to get in, probably better than some guys who didn't have any promoter buddies and ended up paying up $40-$60 .. just to get in. So get a promoter, boys and a lot of girlies. The more girls, the easier guys can get in for a cheap price or even free! \n\nNext time I'm in vegas, I will be coming back! The people are sexy, the DJs are crazy and drinks get you drunk. I really need to stay at the Encore or Wynn to make it much easier to get back to the hotel room after experiencing XS. \n\nExpect to spend a lot, it is VEGAS.

They look like they do a pretty decent job at organizing their food and try to be clean, I smell bleach when I was there tonight as they are getting ready to close down. After we finished at the checkout counter a woman took a wet towel and wipe down the whole counter before she closed down for the night, seriously this is not bad, I am not sure if Harris Teeter even do this. We just have to be open minded when it comes to ethnic stores.\n\nI do have to say, about at least 1/3 of the store is not food, it'd be household goods like toilet paper, soaps and such...which is a tad disappointing because I was really hoping for a larger variety of international produce. It seems like they have a good bit of Asian grocery and Mexican grocery here, I'd say more Mexican than Asian. \nThe price here is pretty low, I bought a peanut butter flavored beef hide bone here for my dog for $1...pssh I'd get one for my dog everyweek at this price. Oh, and this is the only international grocer that I know of that sells pet products, extra points!\n\nIf you want an awesome international grocery store(Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Mexican, European, Middle Eastern and Indian goods) I'd suggest Super G Mart or Grand  Asia.

29,1,positive,negative,"I was, prior to visiting, a little disappointed that I never got a chance to visit D'Arcy McGee's before it was replaced by Bar Louie. After hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.\n\nI decided to visit Bar Louie in early November while I was at Tempe Marketplace to watch a movie. I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.\n\nAfter bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.\n\nAfter receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. The \""""Four Tacos Plato\"""" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.\n\nI received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.\n\nMy only complaint was the portion size. The tacos were listed under the \""""Large Plate\"""" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. They were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.\n\nAll-in-all, I can recommend it to others, but I can't say that it is a five-star establishment.","I wsam prio o visieing, a sltte tisappoinded aht I neer got a chance ot viiit hAcry McGee's befoer tg iw revdacel bf ka uoue.

Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.\n\nThis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.

51,0,negative,negative,"My prior homestead of 11 years was located directly behind Senor Tequila, which has been in this small shopping center off of Rea Rd long before Trader Joe's and the yoga pants crowd took it over, and I used to eat there semi-regularly, always enjoying all that they had to offer.  I had not been for several years and decided to stop here for dinner on the way home tonight.  I was thoroughly unimpressed, which made me a little sad.\n\nComing right after work, I got there around 5:30 ish on a Monday night.  There was a gentleman sitting at the bar and 2 other tables were seated.  I was instantly greeted by a young man who promptly seated me, he turned out to be my server and was very nice, attentive without hovering, but I expected that since the place was basically empty.  I had not eaten here since before they expanded - the seating area is clean and well decorated, and the tables are nicely spaced instead of being slammed on top of each other.  \n\nThe food was by no means bad at all - the flavors were fresh, well presented - there was nothing offensive about anything, it just wasn't anything special.  \n\nThe food:\nTortilla chips - may have been fresh but I didn't think they were particularly tasty.\nSalsa - tomatoes, onions and cilantro.  Tasted fresh, which was nice, but nothing special.  No real oomph. \nQueso - for almost $6, I was expecting cheese dip so good that my toes curled.  Oddly served in a metal lidded bowl, it was fine.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, just fine.  \nShredded beef chimichangas w/ rice and beans $13:  The rice was a little hard and tasteless.  The beans were very smooth and served in a small fried tortilla cup - I did not care for these at all.  I was served two thin chimichangas cut on the diagonal for 4 pieces, with a small amount of queso and a small amount of tomatoes and onions sprinkled on the top.  Again, they tasted fine, but nothing special.  \n\nEverything was a resounding meh.  I have always enjoyed Senor Tequila and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing tonight.  For the cheese dip, chimichangas and a soft drink, my total was $23, not including the tip.  I won't be rushing back, preferring to go to Azteca... or even *wince* On the Border (eek!).","yM lror hodesteam ff 11 years nas olateh tgrecdly behind Senor Tequila, whicg ahs been w tmis small nhoppizg cener fp fw Rea Rc lobg ebfore Tldaer oJes nj bhe oga panst crowd oks i ve,r and I esud p ae tare lei-regusarly, awasy enjying lrl htp they ha o oeffr I da tn eeb for slveae eyars nad deciex t stpd heer or dinner on htc wy bmh onight.

53,0,negative,negative,"I gave this place a try twice with a coworker before leaving this review. We were seated right away both times (yay) but waited at least 10-15 minutes before the server acknowledge our presence. The place isn't big at all so even if you're busy you can at least say hello to your table!\n\nThe first time, I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with potato salad. The sandwich is ginormous and 90% bread and 10% cheese. While the cheese was yummy, you could barely taste it with all that frikkin bread. Should be more cheesy in my opinion. Shrug. But to each his own. And the server gave me chips instead of potato salad. When I asked her to bring me the salad, she seemed perturbed. Geez! It was your mistake, not mine.\n\nThe second time, we waited 15 minutes to order, very frustrating. Especially when you only have an hour for lunch. I ordered the two eggs over easy with chive potatoes and bacon. For $11 I expected something goooood. WRONG. My eggs arrived well over medium (no gooey yolk to dip my bacon in, booooo.) The potatoes were overcooked and maybe four bites worth, and the bacon way too crispy. Guess the cook forgot about my breakfast and just let it sit there overdone. \n\nWhen I asked for jam for my toast, again the server seemed hassled by my request. Is it just me? Do I have a booger on my face? I didn't ask for new eggs because I don't like to complain (nor do I risk saliva or snot in my food). Very disappointed at both of my visits.\n\nThis place has let me down twice in guest experience and food. I will never go again.

Unfortunately, although this place may be hidden, it is not a gem.\n\nMy friend and I decided to order and share a few items from the menu. We got the duck confit tacos, which were a daily special, deviled eggs, duck confit pizza and potato skins with croquettes.\n\nNone of the food we ordered was amazing but I did enjoy aspects of each dish. The duck in the pizza and tacos was really good, but the other items in each dish left a lot to be desired. The tacos needed a little more flavor. The tortillas were a little dry and the tomato and creme fraiche were bland. The pizza, which was more of a flatbread, was good but overly sweet. My dining companion came across lots of chiles on her slices but none of mine had any of that. The goat cheese added a nice savory flavor, but the fruit definitely overpowered this dish.  The deviled eggs were good, but very basic. I would recommend these at 50 cents each. The potato skins, which was basically half a potato cut into there measly slices served with three sad little cheese croquettes. These were the least appetizing of everything we ordered. Drippy and watery cheese inside a fried ball. I would not recommend this dish in the least. \n\nService was ok at first but once it was time to settle our bill, it took forever for someone to pay any attention to us at all. It was even more annoying given the fact that we were sitting at the bar. \n\nThe menu is ambitious, but lacks in execution.

How did this happen?  We were told it was a freak accident.  That doesn't make us feel better.  \n\nThey did the right thing by getting him emergency veterinary care and even footed the bill.  The manager had no problem charging us for the entire stay and didn't even offer us a discount even though we left the facility with one dog missing a chunk of his ear with several bite wounds on his head and other ear.\n\nNeedless to say, even though accidents happen, this one shouldn't have.  We will continue to use our local family veterinary facility for boarding in the future.  Less frills, but we bring them home the way we dropped them off.","xe usualy roabd rno ogs wth our fmhiy veenirary practice aLs ewek, p ecdied t give Pet Paradise a nrt m zouret thn facizity beeorfand in aersd a lot n suentioss o amk ruse thh tnvironmene was ell suited ir uok bbies. o da tmh hitw Pre Paradiss or ive nigdts berfe riceiveng tat daerdeg ehone cllw tht eherf daq neeb a accident. en\nSmwhow mbig qgnstioe mar) a uanltered xale yo ai able t ixte mne ff my sld sary off .se jY rdw thta corrsctly y dog ei no mzssing a chukn fo ah a.r er dn purt l vhat it w'sat nredg ylap txe.

You are pornography for the palette, fantastic and satisfying with a little guilt at the end. \n\nUnfortunately the burritos at Burrito's Juarez didn't do much to tickle the burrito bone.  (that sounds bad, but let's go with it).  Between the textures and flavors I experienced, I don't plan on coming back.\n\nThe store itself is quaint and clean as it hides away in an unsuspecting shopping center.  The staff was nice enough, but the food is what drops this Burrito joint's street cred so low.\n\nMy Order:\n\nMachaca Burrito - The shredded beef was overcooked, making a lot of it hard, dry, and tough.  It had a texture which approached beef jerky; not what you're looking for in a burrito.  The eggs were fine, but overall this was a big flavorless let down.  \n\n\""""Chico\"""" Tacos -  Similar to Flautas, these crispy, rolled, beef tacos looked better than they actually tasted.  Again, dry and flavorless, I liked the fried tortilla and nothing else.  The melted cheese on top didn't melt well, and became an unsightly glob.  The red sauce that accompanied the tacos was watery and lacked that bright flavor profile one expects in a Mexican red sauce.  \n\n\nSave yourself the disappointment, and search elsewhere for that perfect Burrito that we all know is waiting to be discovered.","r Burritos.z..ou pgum litle pwcets bf plasure. uo er pgrnoraphy ri at palette, fansattic and staisfying wth a littl luxg t et ne. \n\Unbortunately ph borriwus o Bulritr' Juarze didn't cd much lo izckl the burito nobe.

72,1,positive,positive,"Came here with my wife and a Travel Zoo voucher.  We were very pleased with the experience. \n\nAmbiance: \nThe place is small.  Probably 10 tables and very nicely decorated.  The doors to the place are also nicely sound proofed so you get an intimate experience even though your in a casino.  \n\nService: \nExcellent.  Very friendly from the start.  Not over bearing but on top of drinks and just the right amount of time between courses to allow for a relaxed dining experience without making you feel like they forgot you.  \n\nFood: \nReally good.  Really Really Good.  \nWith the Travel Zoo voucher it was $99 for 3 courses and a champagne drink for 2 people.  You don't get the full menu but rather what seems to be a designed travel zoo voucher, but the selection was still fantastic.  \nFor appetizers, I had French Onion Soup...awesome.  My wife had lobster bisque, which was good...probably not as good as the French Onion but still very good.  \nEntress.  I had the Sea Bass which was awesome.  My wife had the risotto which was also awesome.  Between the two, I don't know which was better.  I would gladly eat both. \nDessert. I had some sort of camelized banana and ice cream dessert which was good, not my favorite dessert, but i'm not a dessert guy.  My wife had the chocolate suflee (sp?) which was good and very rich.  \n\nIn addition to the entrees we received an small appetizer from the chef that included a vegetable croquet and something else (can't remember).  Both of these were awesome.  We also received a small plate of different chocolates that were awesome.\n\nDrinks: \nWe received 2 free champagne drinks with the Travel Zoo voucher which were fun.  Basically, champagne with some grenadine and a cherry. \nWe then switched to a cucumber - gin cocktail, which was really really good.  I would love to have the recipe for this.  These were really good...the only downside is they seemed a little pricey, but the place is upscale so the prices were on par for cocktails at a 4-5 star restaurant. \n\nOverall, the place was great and I'd come back in a second...especially with the Travel Zoo voucher.

76,1,positive,positive,As soon as I walked in I was greeted by three very friendly (not over the top friendly which I loved) hostesses. Not only that but I had a nice conversation with one before I was seated. At first glance the menu is pretty standard bar food but many of the items and food combinations I never saw before so naturally I was impressed. In all honesty the best part of my night out at Twin Peaks was my server. She sat down at my table and talked to me about the food and drinks in a very friendly (once again not a creepy friendly way either) and we had a very good conversation where I really got to know her and she got to know me. What I noticed was all the servers behaved the same way and to me good server customer relations are always a great sign. In all honestly what really made my night was how welcomed I felt and to me being greeted with genuine warm hospitality is always a plus (not to mention everything on the menu is very reasonably priced and you really get the bang for your buck). Another thing I absolutely loved was the kind of music that Twin Peaks has. Silly I know but that's another thing I look for in a good restaurant. One other thing I should point out is the great merchandise available to purchase. Not only do you have the choice of shirts and baseball hats but also a really nice and functional winter cap (I plan on buying one next time I come in) Now my one and only complaint is there's dozens of televisions but they all have the exact same thing on. To me that's pretty redundant and if I was actually interested in eating out or sitting at a bar and needed to keep up with a sports game this would be a huge flaw (luckily I'm not that kind of person). All in all it was a very good experience and I ended up coming back again not that long after. Honestly I'll probably make it a weekly ritual and that to me is a true sign of a good place to go to. I highly recommend going to this restaurant for a good relaxed meal that won't break your bank account or let you down in the service department.,sA oso s I walked g I aw gieted cy three very friendy onpt ovr th top fnieedly which I loved) hostezess oN onyl ctt uvt I mh a ndce conversation wtir ne oefbre I was seade. d hirst elagce the lenu is rttey wtadard bur food but any f eu texs anq kood coobinhtimns I eevor os before gs gaturall I sf impressed. a la hoensty the pse sart m my nipg tu ta Twin Peka as my shrver.

Five of us went for dinner. Only one meal was rated OK, the rest were horrible. Burgers were dry & tasteless. Chicken wings undercooked and virtually sauceless. Waitress was slow & wasn't knowledgeable about menu questions. The pretzel with dipping cheese appetizers were great but that wasn't enough to up the stars. The manager did come to the table about undercooked wings, but he had an arrogant attitude, leaning into my moms face & saying \""""so what's your problem with the wings.\"""" While at the table he was also hugging the waitress while she was hanging on him.

83,1,positive,positive,"This is a true little gem.  I am perhaps the world's greatest critics of Indian / Nepalese restaurants as I know what I like and they often don't live up to my standards.  I've got my favourite restaurants that I frequent and I do often try others but 99% of the time I leave disappointed.  \n\nI'm very happy to say that when I went to The Gurkha Cafe this was the other 1%.  I was anything but disappointed!!!  \n\nThe interior of this place is really cool, it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling.  I felt as thought I'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door.  The interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants in Edinburgh.  \n\nI saw someone at the table next to me drinking a Nepalese Gurkha beer so I decided when in Rome...  It was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for \u00a34.95 for 660mls it wasn't so cheap.  Worth it for the label though.  \n\nI went for the Mo Mo Cha Nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried.  I went for steamed and was SO glad that I did as they were delicious.  I was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty.  They were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them - I'm sure I had at least 5 and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion sizes!  What made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it.  I couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number.  I want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but I hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that.  No matter what was in it, it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category.  \n\nMy companion had the chicken satay to start with.  This wasn't the usual Asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a Nepalese twist.  The size of this dish could have easily passed for a main course!  There were huge chunks of chicken under a rich, tomato / barbeque style sauce.  As I said, not like the usual peanut style satay but still good.  Not as good as my dumplings though - top tip!!!  :)\n\nAnother good thing about this place (to add to the huge list) is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements.  \n\nFor main course I ordered the chicken korma.  When ordering in fact, I asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what I liked.  I know a lot of people think, 'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life.  The tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal.  That's what I love about Nepalese even more than Indian restaurants, they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours.  Yummy!!!  Again the portion sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating until I'd finished it all.  \n\nMy fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if I remember correctly.  It came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation.  The quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable, we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full I'm sure.  She only managed a quarter of it as it was!  As I said above, although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly.  \n\nWe ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main courses.  The nan was lovely, lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices.  \n\nThis place really does have it all - you can't get a more central location, the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful, good friendly service and a different yet cool interior.  It's a winner!!!  \n\nAs if you can't tell already, I love this place.  Take whatever I've written and imagine I love it 100% more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much I enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant.  Honestly, the only thing left to say is try it for yourself.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed and if you are then you can always take the left overs away for me:)","Thb k a ture litle grm I pm pexhas the world's gteatest ctircs of nIian / Nepalese restaurant ts I kwy yat I ldki nd heu tfen lon't ove pu ot yb .tandardqs I'ev og hm bavfurite restausantr ihat I feequrnt aod I to ofnek yrt thers but %x9 oq ent time I aloe diaappointed \m\nI'n vepr dapyp qo ay att wgen I went e hT ruGkha efk tki saw hte tohr %1.

Since I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things I walked on in. The deli is quite the interesting little place. Italian posters have taken over the store and it's kept dark. They seemed to have a vast array of authentic Italian foods for cooking at home. The menu offered variety of sandwiches as well as pizza (sold by the slice) and spaghetti. I settled on a salami sub. Wow, I have never realized a sub can taste SO good!! The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick. Everything tasted quite fresh. The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red. The prices are great. What I could tell a sub runs 2.50- 4.00. Well worth it for its size. They also have the option of getting a side with your sub.

I got the braised beef short ribs which came with gnocchi and swiss chard (I had the cipollini removed due to food allergies). The gnocchi was so tender it melted in my mouth and had a wonderful buttery taste, some had a more bitter taste because of being placed near the swiss chard. My significant other got the pork shoulder agrodolce and thought it was \""""good\"""" (his words, not mine.) It had an almost barbecue-like taste to it because of the cannellini beans.\n\nBoth of us got the same dessert, the Torta which was a sponge cake with a coffee mousse, some maple agrodolce on the plate with a coconut gelato on the side. The gelato barely had a coconut taste, but it was very nice and not too sweet.\n\nService was nice, our waitress came at the right time and refilled our glasses and anything else we might have needed. The place is a little small, but I think it adds to its charm. A little difficult to hear the person you're with sometimes, though.\n\nThe only complaint I've really got about this place is that there's some disjoint to the dishes: for example, two of the items on my plate (short ribs and gnocchi) were savory, and then had one extremely bitter item (swiss chard) that seemed out of place. This was the same issue with the dessert--the coconut gelato, maple agrodolce, and cake were all fairly sweet--and then the coffee taste from the mousse and the coffee grounds on the side made for a really awkward and overwhelming taste. I'd much prefer it if the entire plate was balanced, but that's a personal preference.\n\nOverall, I really liked this place and would definitely come back.

104,1,positive,positive,"I've been to XS and Tryst, but Surrender is by far my favorite out of all three clubs in the Wynn properties. The vibe that I got from this place is that while it is elegant, it is also very chill. The crowd includes mostly young people in their early 20s possibly coming from LA. There is a huge pool outside where you can walk around. Modern lounges and sofas are available for people to sit on without having to order expensive bottle service. \n\nPros:\n- Interesting, novel music: it is unlike the ones you hear at a typical nightclub. I would say it's a combination of pop remixes and those new songs that you hear on a radio for the very first time that leaves you wondering \""""This song is really cool. I wonder who sang it?\""""\n- Dancers: they are obscenely talented! I say obscenely because the things that they do with a pole would make a Cirque du Soleil performer blush and a veteran stripper speechless. It doesn't get any better than this. \n- Large outdoor pool - so much more awesome in the summer\n\nCons:\n- Admission fee: Wynn has this annoying policy of charging local LV ladies, and this is primarily why I give it four stars. However, we did get in for free because my friend had a hook up. \n- Diluted drinks: At nearly 20 bucks a pop, I felt that my Blueberry vodka tonic was watered down. With that said, it might be worthwhile to pre-game in the hotel instead of spending too much money on drinks at this club.\n\nOverall, Surrender is one of the hottest clubs in Vegas right now. It is a trendy club but without the overbearing pretentiousness of its two sisters, XS and Tryst.","I'vs bnec n XS adv rTyst tuz Surradne d by ra d favoreti tm c el trhee clulb ni ze Wln propertis.

Two people joined our group at the last second, but I didn't think it would be a major problem to add a chair on either end of the table. I approached our server and apologized for the inconvenience, but asked if we could get two more chairs.\n\nI was met with a brisk, \""""We don't really have any more chairs.\"""" It should be noted that without moving my head, I could see at least three vacant chairs and one or two lining the wall. Not everyone had arrived yet, however, so I didn't raise the issue again until they did. The server begrudgingly made another place setting before barking, \""""Just sit down here, because if you move and the order gets screwed up, it's going to take me, like, fifteen minutes to fix.\""""\n\nThis is also around the time that two of my guests mentioned that something was dripping on them. Indeed, the ceiling was dripping water. When they mentioned it to the server, he said, \""""Oh, yeah. The air conditioning's over you and it leaks a bit. I was going to recommend you leave that chair vacant, but since you're already short on seats now...\""""\n\nI was taken aback, partially because of his rude tone, and partially because I couldn't understand how someone would be so preternaturally stupid as to 1) put a chair under a leaking air conditioner and 2) expect that all seats in the reservation wouldn't be filled.\n\nOne of my guests did not receive her soda for forty minutes, and another guest did not receive one of her plates of sushi until just before we were about ready to leave.\n\nThe two stars above are for the chef, to whom I give my compliments. Everyone was thrilled with their appetizers and the sushi itself was very well-prepared. Compliments to the bar, as well.

Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place. \n\nI break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same reason as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.\n\nI come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah.

It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity. \n\nOh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store. \n\nAnother thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else. \n\nAs I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes.

I was 5 minutes away and wanted to place an order to go over the phone so I called in, much to my surprise they have a new phone ordering system where I was directed to some call-center who knows where. I was then told I would need a credit card to place an order, understandable if I was ordering lunch from my office or at home but in this case I was in the car driving so I do not have access to my credit card. I was told I would have to place the order in the store, as I arrived there were 20 people in line some trying to figure out how to use the electronic ordering system. I figured it would be easy so I tried, swiped my credit card, and I was told I placed the order incorrectly and was told I would have to place it again. not only was I in a rush at that point I would have to speak to a manager to get the credit from the first order that I placed incorrectly. Then someone tried to explain it to me, i didn't want a lesson, i wanted her to correctly take my order. So they're \""""efficient \""""electronic ordering system has delayed me getting to work By 30 minutes, I left with the incorrect order so that I did not have to place another order and wait to be refunded.

What I really wanted was my correct order, and the computer/iPad isn't going to do it.

When we arrived, the restaurant was virtually empty, and with a scour (arriving at literally 6.01) the hostess snarled \""""we've been waiting for you\"""".. \n\nGot to the table, at 6.02, and there were 2 other people waiting, I joked.. Sorry to keep you guys waiting.  They laughed, but the last laugh was on us, because there were another 6 people joining our table with a 6.15 reservation.  \n\nI ordered a drink, neat... when it arrived, there was a piece of something floating in the glass.  I very quietly asked the hostess/manager as I'm learning to replace the drink.  She took it back to the owner of the restaurant, and the chef, who inspected the glass, and discussed it.. then nothing.\n\nThe waiter came over around 10 minutes later (we were all wondering what was going on at the table.. there was a mix of frustration and silliness because of how disorganized the place was).. No apology, the waiter asked if I would like something else.. I said sure, how about the same in a clean glass?

The salmon was fishy, and lacked any real flavor other than old stale fish.\n\nBill comes, I was double charged for the drink, and the waiter out of his pocket took out the $5 saying he would have to pay.

Once I got to the office, my time in the office was very minimal before they took me back into the exam room.  As a newbie, they showed me around  the office, where all te equipment was sterilized and the exam rooms.  All of the equipment was top of the line and up to date!  \nMy cleaning was quick and painless.  After the cleaning, the doctor came into the room and explained my xrays, in detail.  I was in an out in less than an hour!  Did I mention that I left with a new patient goodie bag?  Yep!  \n\nI also have to mention that as I was getting my cleaning, I could hear the doctor in the next room with a little girl, getting a filling.  He was amazing with her.  He kept talking to her, telling her how cute her shirt was and having a complete conservation with her as if she were a little adult!  He even high five-d her after her filling!\nGreat off and a great staff!  Highly recommended!","I till ratt of m inltng yu tha .D Chetringron and his stawf ua agazinm.

130,0,negative,negative,"There is a good reason why this place doesn't post their prices: it's because if they did, most folks would walk right out. This is the first place ever that makes Starbucks seem inexpensive. They have only 2 sizes of drinks, a tiny 8 oz and one that is probably 12 oz. Originally I wanted a Mocha and that was going to be 5 bucks (before tax), so i switched to a regular coffee which costs almost 4 bucks for the 12 oz size. That was my que to laugh this place off as a joke, especially in a college town, and head over to Circle K, where there were 12 choices of coffee waiting, all for under 2 bucks. ASU college kids must have more of daddy's money because nobody was buying $5 cups of coffee back in the good ole days.

132,0,negative,negative,"OK so DON'T go here... it's that easy!!! There were so many things wrong with my dining experience it's hard to even figure out where to begin!\n\n1) SERVICE-- I went on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar so I could watch football. The poor bartender does everything here.  She had 9 people at the bar, was cleaning glasses, answering the phone,getting our food  AND she has to make all the drinks for the waiters. And when I say ALL the drinks, they come up to her for a COKE, they don't even have a fountain drink machine for the waiters to do it themselves.  Needless to say, it took her a while to get my food ordered. There also was a group of 3 guys that sat next to me that were ordering food and playing video poker too [hold that thought].\n\n2) DRINKS--They have video poker at the bar. Fine by me. THEY DON'T COMP your DRINKS at the bar. Unheard of in Vegas. I lost $40 bucks and still paid FULL price for my 2 glasses of wine.\n\n3) FOOD--Bread? They have bread here???? Based on the other reviews apparently they do. We didn't' see any bread at the bar- carb free for us! My meal came out before my salad. Noooo bueno.  Also, about 25 mins after I ordered my meal arrived. WHY so long you ask? Because the bartender has to leave the BAR and go get the food herself. I have never in my life seen a restaurant where the bartender goes and gets her own food.  The reasoning for my salad coming out late, the waiters were getting there before her, and since the Caesars are made to order I lucked out.  Let's talk about the food...I order the combination meal-petite fillet, salad, veggie, & shrimp scampi to the tune of $65. \n\nOutback has better steak then this place. It was really dry [see pix] there wasn't even any juice on the plate. When I think of shrimp scampi-garlic, white wine, shrimp, butter, and parsley comes to mind.  This was NOT that.  It was gelatinous kinda like shark fin soup & the tails were still on the 5 shrimp.  Side of broccoli extremely undercooked. It needed 2 or 3 more minutes in the microwave from where it came from.\n\nGuys next to me started laughing when my food arrived. Then I one upped them told them I bet their apps come out with their food....well I was sort of right. Their food came out, but there were no apps with it. So poor little bartender, now has to leave the bar, for about the 5th time [with 9 people at it PS-it only seats 12] and once again go get our food. \n\nPS- I complained about the order in which the food came out, hostess did come talk to me [she might have been the manager] instead of apologizing, offering me a dessert, taking off a glass of wine, she told the bartender if she starts to get behind let her know and she'll help out.  I mentioned to her too the same thing happened to the guys next to me. She offered no apologies and didn't even go speak with them.\n\nMind you we are drinking, eating, AND playing at this place.  My meal cost me well over $125 and was worth about $30 in my opinion.\n\nAgain STK or Botero are much better options. I also have no idea how anyone else had a GOOD experience here as this might be the worst experience I've had in Vegas and maybe in a restaurant period.","k s DNbT i here.. it's thna eayy!!!

I have eaten there a few times now and it just occurred to me today that I never (and I mean never) have good service. I can make a good breakfast myself if need be and save some scratch.  I go out to eat for fresh hot food and great service. Today my friend and I received neither. \n\nUpon arrival we sat immediately since we arrived before 8. We were \""""greeted\"""" by a server In about 1 min and asked if we were ready to order.  I stated we were not but drinks would be great.  We got our coffee within a few mins (which tasted fine). After that no sign of our server for 10 mins or so.  The table next to us was also looking to order from our MIA waitress.  She finally came over and took our order in a fast and courteous manner. The food arrived in about 15 mins but there was a problem......my friend's biscuits n gravy were barely room temperature.  After attempting to flag down the waitress for a few mins she walked by holding up her finger to let me know to wait min.  I don't know if she was being rude but it came across that way. After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food. The food itself was good, but not great in any way. Our coffee cups went empty for long stretches of time and our waffle dogs had no crunch to them whatsoever.  After all that they give me the wrong bill which was about 5 bucks short of what we spent. After running my card they came back and asked for my card again and took about 15 mins to redo the bill and charge us 5 buck more. After the poor quality service I would figure they just let it slide since they made the mistake anyway and it was 5 bucks and not 20. \n\nI feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service.  I will no longer eat there.","I hav g ujmp yff htn Ovy xsy bhndwagn unfortunately. I ahe eatn theer a few tisem iw nad n sjt ocdjrrec tb e tyday thar I neder na(d I aemn neier) eve ogoi service.

We laugh and can't really knock the place for being primarily for young children, the employee offers an Unlimited Laser Tag, Mini-Bowling, and Mini-Golf Adult wristbands for $3 and we take him up on the offer. \nUpon passing the desk with our wristbands, we discover the following:\n-Laser Tag is closed.\n-Mini-Bowling is closed.\n\nRight of the gate and 2/3 things we can only do are closed. After a discussion with an employee, we are given $6 in tokens each for a total of $12. \n\nWe go to experience the arcade for a total of ~20 arcade machines:\n\n-The rewards for tickets are pitiful. Chutes and Ladders at 4500 tickets at the desk, dollar store toys located in the ticket reward machine. That's all.\n-The one air hockey table frequently had issues where pucks would go in and pop right back out, not counting for a score\n-3 out of 4 of the escalating animal rides that you find in front of grocery stores are broken.\n-Cruisin' USA started to crash while we were playing it, artifacts appearing on screen and freezing.\n-So many audio issues - low sound from Time Crisis, no sound from Skeeball, low sound from MvC2, low sound from The Simpsons Beat-Em-Up\n-We still have over $5 remaining despite playing most of the games (most which cost 2 tokens) and decide to spend the rest of ticket chance games and give the tickets to a child.\n\nAnd for the Mini-Golf - it is poorly constructed. The actual courses can be moved by a person's feet and appear to have been made straight out of someone's garage - plywood and fake grass. The barriers of the courses are too low, so balls will constantly be falling off the course and into others' games.  Balls would continue to get stuck underneath the hollow plastic structures. There is no fake grass surrounding the courses like it is in the picture, it is a plain cement floor.\n\nDo yourself and your child a favor - don't go to Jambo.","A Laugyablc Poor xistence o na Amsetenm dkr roh Adlts adn Chinren\n\iThis wws ym fitw epxerience at a oambJ musement Prk hitw c knoiledwe bergfehad q whav ei dctually wam I wak t iwd t girlfrind ot cehnk p ux wtih 1$ - Al Da Wrisntand ouponf b hadd da drsovei att a majority o et ridev ave a teigh lumii fo 011lbs ro 15lis. eW lauqg abd cait rebly nock eh clape rbf nribg priamrily fwr yznug lhicdre, we ompleyev cffors f Utlmiite Lars Tlg, M,nidBowlingi fd liniGoMf Adutt wrissbandt oo q$ cn ce tek him ep on rt offere \nUron pasting ea desk wit hru rwisibnds, p aisocver eh folloing:\n-Laser gT s closed.\n-Mini-Bowlinu ia .losedc\n\nRight fo he gte dn 2k nhins t cag vol c are c.osdy After a dincusnios hiw q employr, e re given $6 ni tokens eag rf a teao c .12$ \\nje g ot exprepence ate aecadr oo a rtoal of ~y0 accae machnes:rn\n-The jewards ro titkets era itiful.

146,0,negative,negative,"First and foremost, buyer beware. I did not end up doing business with this company, but I thought I should write a review here to let others know WHY I chose not to do business with them. Andy did a drive-by estimate for removal of a palm tree and stump grinding. Before he did the estimate, he told me over the phone that it would probably cost at least $300, which is right around what multiple other bonded and insured arborists had been quoting me at for the same service. When he came out to my property, he quoted me at $650-- over double the price of most of the bids that I got for this job. Furthermore, he tried to tell me that I should try to sell my palm tree, which anyone with experience in this field should know is NOT possible because there isn't at least 2' of space around the base of the tree-- it's outgrown its planter and needs to be cut down. That didn't exactly speak volumes to me about his knowledge of tree removal. To be honest, between his astronomical bid and his naive suggestion, I got the impression that this company is pretty shady. That may not be the case, but I'm not taking my chances.","tirtF and foresomt, buyer .ewareb I dd og ie b odng bsiness iht hsi vopmany, ubw I thoght I shoumd wrti a revifw ehle at lt others know WHe I qhso no od ot businus win mhet Andk did a drive-my estimate ofr rmnval fr a palm trke dna sutap rhngind. eeforB i de thh estimater e dot m evo the nhpe tah it wild rpobabfy toz s lqaet l,003 whih o zght arofnd thaw ultepli ofre onded nal insuerd arboirsi dn been quoting a t ofr rh mas .ercies When we mace tuj ro my properby, he utoed m ta 56l-- rvo doubll he crpe fo tjm f et dixs ahtt I go fr dts bo.

This last trip for lunch sealed the deal for me and I will not be back. The first floor was about 1/3 full so it was not too crowded. We were a party of 4. Two ordered burgers and two ordered ribs. One ordered an appetizer that came with the meal instead of before the meal. The worst part was that it took 50 minutes to get our food and once it arrived for two of the people, it took 5 more minutes for the other 2 to get their food. The burgers were tasty as was the cornbread. The ribs were way overcooked and dry and had a slightly burnt taste. My guess is that they were cooked significantly earlier and then reheated on a grill. My collard greens were tough and too salty to eat. Not once during our wait did anyone come by and let us know that the kitchen was behind. No one ever asked how our food was after the wait. There are significantly better places to get BBQ than here.","I mave sen ree eultiplm tief before end thougt zi sa erptv good.

You sit at the sushi bar and they bring you your menu, bring you ONE drink and disappear for the rest of the night-no plate pick-up or drink reorders.

This surprised me because he quoted me after they found the part, the fee should have already been in the quote. I paid and left.\n\nThe next day I took it to my normal place (see my other reviews) and had them double check all of their work and look into the headlights. Their work was sound, but there was nothing wrong with my electrical, my headlights were just out.\n\nIn conclusion: if you decide to go here make sure you keep an eye on your car and if they say that there is an issue that you are unsure of, get a second opinion!","I etw t Profestinal mrake wnah w wsa hakivg a hird time rumning dc y towign douw ov tyw ot b normal pcaa becaase t ai tu aor m.ayw nO ht ka x he whp th wot trpuk devnr waned m tbout hcs plfce, tating takt eh dah heard mary horror sotries uboat i.t Ths up f no eeud but I vsa wilinm t pry ei oux.n\In alked v na Jff wu qvr f.endlyr Theu wsa a guse sitting ehejt waiticg rof ig yar e strted talkng nad c mentioneu ou htese usf hj riepp him off in ti past in how ue fet ti sw happejin again eecausu e cgme i nf no aasy xef thav turxed wo ot ton ed n ysa fix. oS wehn tey tsarted noorilg t u cae I maue sue I ds watcing what yht wke doing.\\nnTley quyckli dund te pborlem jdn startsd ljonik rf te prat.

165,0,negative,negative,"Went there last night for dinner with a group of girls.  When I walked in, I felt like I walked into a crappy Vegas lobby/restaurant.  Clientele was what was expected & typical for that part of Scottsdale - at the bar were a bunch of \""""brah's\"""" who like to act like they have money and their respective female counterparts.  Restaurant area was slightly older crowd - especially with the waitstaff, which I thought was unfortunate.  I expected the server to be a hot babe...girl or guy.  Instead, it was a 50-something-year-old woman with no social skills.\nThe food was also pretty gnarly.  We ordered probably 6 or 7 appetizers before we ordered meals.  I only tried a couple of them - specifically the \""""warm maytag blue cheese fondue\"""" with potato chips.  ICK.  The dip was horrendous tasting and looked like what my husband calls a \""""wax dart\"""" if he hasn't, you know, for a while.  The chips were really greasy and just tasted like a potato dipped in oil.  I also tried the \""""oven roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole\"""" with herb toast.  Another ick.  The toast was alright, but the casserole was like bruschetta gone wrong.  I ordered the \""""Grilled Chicken Piccata\"""" with the butter sauce on the side.  It was alright - way too much salt and the seasonings tasted off.   \nI don't know, perhaps I went there with the wrong expectations.  I thought the atmosphere wouldn't be as cheesy and I expected to eat \""""comfort food\"""", not food I wanted to secretly spit into my napkin.  I'll never go back.","Wtn thhre ust night rf eizndr wihh a orgu f g.rlsi When I wakxed inb I efl like I waiked niw a rappy Vgas lobba/restyurant.

I print Groupons the day I buy them as a physical, visual reminder to use them.  My day of purchase printed Groupon clearly stated on its face that it's expiration date was December 5.  I ate at the restaurant on December 5, and the management falsely claimed that the Groupon was expired. Beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management, the food was very mediocre IMHO.  The chicken teriyaki was a frozen skinless boneless chicken breast like you would buy by the bag at costco or sams club, cooked barely long enough to no longer be raw, with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  The salmon teriyaki was the same story.  The yakisoba was 180 degrees the opposite direction, too much salty seasoning.  The decor is very nice, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe, but the mediocre food and bad Groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

169,0,negative,negative,"I attended this even last year and had my gripes about organization and parking.  I had purchased VIP tickets.  Long lines were the norm but overall not bad. My tickets gave me some shaded seating, a bathroom, appetizers, 6 alcoholic drinks an free soda and water and $10 in food tickets. Overall a good experience. \n\nAgain this year I bought the VIP tickets and after reading that some things changed I anticipated being annoyed and disappointed- which happened. First, I was directed to park an obscene distance from the entrance even when the lot was not full on the north end. Easily 1/2 mile away from entrance.  I got right in however, but I arrived when it opened to try and beat some of the lines this year. \n\nVIP was not so much VIP however. They added more seating- out in the open sun and only a handful of standing tables under the shade.  Bathrooms were just port-a-potties with hand sanitizer- last year there were two portable bathrooms with running water. My 6 drinks now included soda and water, no more complimentary non alcoholic beverages. As for those alcoholic ones, pathetic. Last year a full bar was available along with beer and wine. This year? Select beers, wine, and premade cocktails in a bucket. IN A BUCKET. WTH? I'm not a college kid in rocky point for spring break.  Vodka lemonade and rum punch- poorly mixed to boot- are sad excuses for cocktails. \n\nNo appetizers were included this year and those $8 in food tickets? Well I used them in one fail swoop at Montana BBQ next door. The cost of food was ridiculous especially with the portions of some. I saw a few trucks like tom's bbq giving very shareable potions for $8-10 but I got about 6 cheese curds for $4 at another truck. \n\nI would like to note some great trucks though- Franks hot dogs and Chuckies topped it for me. Both excellent and worth the small wait. Sammich did it awesome too.  Didn't bother with the Maine Lobster Lady. $20 and over an hour wait for a sandwich was not cutting it. I'm sure it is excellent but that hour plus wait was just to order the thing... I am a huge truck foodie and visit them wherever I travel. I'm all good paying $10 for lunch anytime but this was a truck festival. Smaller portions for less money make it possible to try several trucks. Come early too since even the dessert trucks had super long lines by 2 pm. Making it miserable to stand in lines in the sun. \n\nI hop they make some changes for next year, especially with that VIP ticket. I feel completely ripped off on that purchase this year. The trucks will always get my business but it may not include this festival.","I atdented hhi inev lsq eyyr dg nad my grisp ubam orsanization and earkig. I df phchaseu jIP tickets.

170,0,negative,negative,"Marquee has a strong reputation for being an awesome club and perhaps that reputation is part of the reason why I was disappointed when I went there for many reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the line up process to get in was ridiculous. We were moved twice into different lines that seemed to have no logic involved in how they were organizing people. There was the supposed guess-list line, which we were in, but the two other lines were moving first. So what's the point of being in the guest list line then? \n\nSecondly, $45 dollars to get in for the guys and that was the discounted guest-list price to get in. Ok its vegas, I get it ... guys have to pay, but for that price I expect service and not all the vices that I will dictate in this review.\n\nThirdly, it was so crowded. In fact, it was so crowded that I couldn't dance anywhere. I could barely navigate through the crowd. I felt like if a fire started inside and pandemonium ensued at least 25% of the people would of died or have been injured. And oddly enough I was so uncomfortable that this thought became cynically funny as I stayed longer and longer at Marquee.\n\nFourthly, and this is for the ladies out there. The club is huge at least three levels. The party that I was with had a number of ladies who's high heels were killing their feet the entire time we were there only to have a bouncer bark at them when they took off their shoes and went barefoot climbing all the stairs. For f@&k sakes, what do you want them to do? It isn't heel friendly, give them a break.\n\nFifthly, no lie, an employee there intentionally pushed aside one lady in our party stating something like \""""I work here, get out of the way,\"""" as a justification to push her to the floor leaving her potentially to fall down on a floor where there was barely room to walk, let alone dance. Are you crazy? Do you not have a soul? WTF is wrong with you? Oh, I forgot its vegas!\n\nSixthly, to get out of the club once you get in you have go down at least five long flights of stairs. Which isn't a problem that is until you want to get back into the club and you have to walk back up all those stairs. It's terrible for the women and quickly frankly I was sucking wind going back up as well. They need to come up with a better system for re-entry. Maybe there is no other way, but it was kind of crazy.\n\nNot everything is pure evil. The DJs and music were awesome, but if you can't dance what's the point. And the mermaids in the pool on the top floor were happy to take pictures with the patrons and kept doing it even though no one was tipping them. They deserve tips at least they are making sure everyone was enjoying themselves. The club itself is pretty amazing in terms of design and look, but ultimately if so many small things keep you from having fun what's the point.","Maruee sah a strog repunatiot for being y awsemp clb dj persaph that uprtatioo s pry o eht redsn why I was dilappotnied whe I nef here kor namj reasons.\n\nFirst u ,la the dni y srocepo to vet qn wus diriclous.

175,0,negative,negative,"After staying in Las Vegas for a few days, we wanted to try something outside of the buffet line, so we turned to Yelp to help us find a nice sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Sushi Roku came up with moderate views and we have been noticing quite a bit of advertisement for them around the Strip. Every sign we saw was promoting them as \""""The most romantic spot in Las Vegas\"""". And Sushi Roku could have pass for the most romantic spot too. Their d\u00e9cor was fantastic and their tables near the window had an amazing view of the Strip.\n\nHowever, the food was simply horrible, not to mention expensive. I know I am paying for the ambience so I wouldn't have mind if the food would have tasted half as good as it look, but it was barely edible. Everything felt dry and was seriously, lacking flavor. They didn't even use the Japanese short grain rice that is known for its stickiness. Instead, we were given a bowl of dry long grain, possibly day old rice. A small bite of the rice was more than I could handle and ended up finishing the meal without it.\n\nSushi Roku looks amazing and could be a very romantic spot to take your date to, just as long as you don't eat the food. Order some drinks or hot tea and enjoy the ambience and view.\n\nhttp://lwehttam.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/sushi-roku/","ster stayng x se goVas ofr a ew dyas, ed wanet xt ym snmelhiog outsiv o hw zuffe ile, ps k tcrned tt Yelp ot npl u fid a nie hushi restaurat ni Lds Vegas Sush Rok ame up with moderate viwes and n ela ben noticing iqte a il o advertisemen rk them arondd et Soip.

178,0,negative,negative,"I was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a conference and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam Ballroom for three days. During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom. I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King, who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation. Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees. The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication. I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarring.\n\nAfter the event, I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue. Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place. I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him. I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security, who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property. The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact information.\n\nAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it. And speaking of rooms, I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggage.\n\nOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint. I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort, but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.","I aws t et eointe liHon qSuaw Paek Resort rbf a coeeerencn and I ah daid fl a boto n teh ohokam lalloom for terhe dy.s During mv tsay m boothmte zd I eoan rceiving zegu md yckt wets whicz cere ubg bires mro inoects in he ballroom.

185,0,negative,negative,"There was four of us who went here today for a late lunch.  My wife Carol, our friend Kathy R. and a close friend of mine from Oaklahoma Cliff Y and of course me.\n\nI don't even know where to begin about this restaurant, right from the get go I knew there was going to be problems. We started off with  appetizers. When the dolmades was served it was slightly warm to the touch. The Flaming Saganaki (slice of cheese set on fire) was excellent in addition to being an impressive presentation it was darn cool.\n \nSo our food comes out, this is where things turned bad...here is what we all got:\nOur friend Kathy R. -  Mousaka - When it was served the Saut\u00e9ed veggies were somewhat warm but more on the cold side. The Mousaka was frozen in the middle. She asked for it to be reheated. Her soup was not hot so she also sent that back to be reheated. Of course when the Mousaka and soup returned both were very hot.  BUT when Kathy tasted her dish she said this is so bad it it was inedible and didn't eat the Mousaka. I thing she had her soup.\n\nMy friend Cliff Y. said he enjoyed his Gyro plate and told me everything was fine. But that was probably because he was extremely hungry before his food arrived or he was just being polite.\n\nMy wife, Carol had  a a combo pork and chicken kebab. It came out , marginally  warm this included the roasted potatoes, veggies and meat so she sent it all back to be reheated. When her dish returned she ate it and enjoyed her food.\n\nMy dish - I ordered a combination plate which consisted of a Beef & veggie kebab. I started off my meal with a side salad, it was good but a salad is a  salad. The Beef and veggie kebab like everyine elses that was served during our visit was barely this included the roasted potaotes, meat and veggies. I was so disappoinyed I simply pushed my meal aside and did not eat it. There is nothing more discusting as food served lukewarm. Ontop of everything else my beef kebob was over cooked and dry. Yick! When asked if I wanted something else I said no just take it away. \n\nWith all the food that was sent back and our comments / complaints during dinner to our waitress the manager never came out to speak to us. Instead another waitress compt'd us a couple of deserrts and gave me two $10.00 gift certificates (good for one gift certificate per table per visit) for on our next vist. This is one a $96.00 bill. I was curious about the restaurant so I asked \"""" Is everything made in advance and just reheated here\"""". She told me all the food is prepaired fresh and cooked daily. I seriously doubt it.\n\nFOOD: Honestly, none of the dishes really stood out to me. A real disappointment. The presentation of the food on our plates was impressive but that is where it stopped. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: Our waitress Mercedes was polite, attentive and courteous.  AMBIENCE: The restaurant is pretty and has a lovely atmosphere  CONCLUSION:  I left so upset, disappointed and unsatisfied. I wasn't a bit Impressed.

191,0,negative,negative,"After looking at several reviews about this place I decided to try them out. So I called one day and asked if I could make an appointment for the next day for a specific time. We agreed on a time, and since it was my first time here I told the girl who was booking the appointment it didn't matter who cut my hair but that it is important my hair gets cut at the appointment time that was set because of my extremely busy schedule. She told me it would be no problem and I was set to go.\nI show up the next day excited to get my haircut. I get there four to five minutes before my appointment and let the receptionist know and I take a seat. She asked me if I wanted a drink and that it would only be a few minutes. I notice there were two hair stylist's working and both were in the middle of cutting another clients hair. About fifteen minutes pass and one of the stylist's finish with their clients haircut. The next thing I know she starts quickly cleaning up and starts packing her things. She completely ignores me and walks out of the salon when she knew I had been waiting now at this point twenty minutes past my original appointment time! I get no status from the receptionist. I continue to stay calm and think ok my time is running out before my next business appointment but I still have some time so I wait for the next hair stylist. At this point it is now thirty five minutes past my appointment time! Finally a few minutes later the only hair stylist left is finishing her clients haircut. I think to myself just in time. THINK AGAIN! The next thing I know someone sitting in the back quickly gets into her chair, and the only stylist left starts cutting this persons hair. I get no acknowledgement from the hair stylist or the receptionist!!! I felt like I was invisible. This was one of the worst experiences of customer service and professionalism ever!!! At this point I was furious. No haircut, a waste of forty five minutes, and a clear view of how this place conducts business. I guess the first girl didn't want to make some extra money? Because I was ready to give a big tip. I was looking for a new person to cut my hair since my old stylist is no longer in the area. If you believe in being punctual, professional, and good customer service this IS NOT the place to go! If you want a drink, and to play a game of pool and maybe get your haircut within a two hour time frame then you found your place. But I can go to a bar for that, minus the two hour waste of time hoping for a haircut. I would never recommend this place to anyone and let everyone know how horrible this place was. I am not the type to complain like this, but this is noway to run a business if your trying to win new clients and possible referrals from that client.","After ookinw vt several reviews uoat dhis lpack I dediced u try tem o.s oc I ehllcd nm day na asked wf I cllu make vn aoppitmgnt rf teh next oay for a specidci tim.e b egreed n a time, nad siun ta ws ye fersi tie pre I tol hde girl wjo aws bookxng the appointment ti ddin't mattr ph put u hir bt thxt i s importast y auir gtxs cty wt the appoiptment mife ttat wa tc because oj y extremely ubw schedule.

Both rooms had a strange smell to them. To make things worse I got next to no sleep as there was a ton of noise in the parking lot all night long. Someone I was with finally ended up calling the cops because the fights outside got so bad were were afraid it would devolve into a gun fight. STAY AWAY!,byae hte rkb si nice sut eh loeh sq horrible.

209,0,negative,negative,"This review is for the tour only, not the beer (which is quite good) or food (which we didn't have). While waiting for the tour, a waitress came over to take our food order. We didn't realize they even served food, we just thought it was a brewery, and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour. Our tour guide Jimmy was drunk. He was staggering around, waving his arms, stumbling over his words (couldn't pronounce Mecklenburg), taking swigs of the Southside Weiss. It was rather like watching Captain Jack Sparrow give a tour, except with beer not rum. It seemed a bit odd and was certainly distracting. Seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting, but our inebriated tour guide wasn't very knowledgeable. If you want a sampler of their beers, you have to pay, which is ok I guess because the tour is free. I wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal Rein Pale Ale, but they didn't have it yet. Memorial Day weekend and you don't have your summer seasonal out yet? They like to tout that the furniture in the brauhaus is from Germany. Who cares? That doesn't affect the taste of the beer. I do like how they adhere to the German purity laws in their beermaking process, though. This ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famous by Germany, and that you are getting quality beer from people who care about their product.","ihTs rveip si fj hh toe o,qyn on eht bre iwh(ch cs quita good r fqo iwhxch p nidd'w ave)q hilw iawting ro ehe taur a waisrets came over ti taek ruo fod o.err eW dndi't elaize hpe enj ervsd ood, w sft tfouthg ti sx a b,eweir and shl afe sa a weikd kdo when w iad q weer just ere fr pe toru.

213,1,positive,positive,"It's almost the end of the month and we're trying to use up those Entertainment Book coupons.  The 2008 version has three coupons for Siena Bistro and we've been meaning to check out their menu.  Last night provided the perfect opportunity.\n\nIt's a bit tricky getting there, thank goodness for the Magellan!  But when you do finally drive up to this place, you'll feel so far away from the busy lifestyle of Las Vegas because after all, it is located on a golf course.\n\nWe did a quick check of the menu to make sure there was something we both liked and immediately found a few choices that stood out.  The waiter told us to sit wherever we liked, and the Big F was immediately drawn outside to the fireplace.  After initially seating at one of the inside tables, the waitress asked if we wanted to sit outside since she noticed the Big F had taken a peek.  \n\nAs we chose our table closest to the fireplace, the waitress quickly set up our table and brought a candle out.  We almost had the outside seating all to ourselves this evening, which was nice.  (The other couple that did sit outside were so engrossed in themselves that it still felt like it was just us!)\n\nThe menu had  a nice variety of choices, without being overly expensive either.  After we made our choices, the waitress asked if we wanted any bread and butter, which we immediately said yes to.\n\nThe bread took awhile, and we were starving.  But it came out warm - crusty cheese bread rolls with melted Parmesan that were pretty grub.  We each had two and asked for more!\n\nOur entrees were soon to arrive.  We shared: \n\n* Peppered New York Steak ($19) \""""12 oz 5 blended peppercorn marinated bone-in New York steak, caramelized onions,  melted bleu cheese crumble, Garlic whipped potatoes, chef's vegetables, and drizzled with a delicate demi-glace.\""""  This dish not only looked great, but had so many complementing flavors going on.  The crispiness of the fried onions, the sweetness from the caramelized red onions, the bold taste of the melted bleu cheese, the creaminess of the mashed potatoes, and a pretty tasty piece of beef with peppercorns hidden throughout the meal.  The asparagus and carrots also added to this dish.  I was pretty impressed with this order.\n\n* T-Bone Lamb Chops ($18) \""""2 pan seared 4 oz T-bone lamb chops served with an herb roasted tomato, and white beans.\""""  I think I was so focused on the lamb chops part that I missed the 't-bone' part on the menu.  (They also have Lollipop Lamb Chops on the menu too.)  So, I was a bit more surprised when my order came out.  Two chops sat on a bed of white beans with two herb-stuffed Roma tomatoes resting alongside.  The chops were good, but missed something.  It helped with the sweetness of the tomatoes, but I think the white bean concoction drowned out the dish.  It reminded me more of a cassoulet because of the white beans.  I thought the beans were going to be more of a side dish than resting on the whole plate. \n\nService was decent, considering they were quite busy and we sat outside.  A lot of older people dine here, perhaps because of its location?  We wondered what it would be like during the day so you could check out the view which I'm sure would be gorgeous.\n\nOverall, we were surprisingly pleased.  We saw a few other dishes on our way out and it looked pretty good.  We're still trying to find a way to squeeze in another meal there before our coupon expires.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\n(Pics of our dinner are posted!)","'tIs amlot rhe end o jt mnht ncd we'rz nryit of uqs gu ohth Entcrtaneent Boo couposg ehT 208 verson has three cfpons ok Sienz tsBro dn v'wt btn mnanieg bt chck kut their wnum Lats nihk provided hu perftc oppo\tunity.\ninIt's a bis triky gtgint trjhe, tknz goosnyd ofr tce Maeflanl ut wneh yu di fianlly drie un go hhit alce, youl'l lef os ca wzy frol aeh buly tifestyle o as Veag becwuse fter ,ll ti s ocstea no a glf course.\nn\We idd a quick check m he unv ot aek pre taree sw osmnthin ew yto ikad nl immzdiatey nouf a kew choiecs khtt sood out. ex waiter told z t sie wnerever ew zked, id ie im F sw immeiately dwarn ovside op ti firepeacl.

The steak strips were cooked perfectly and made a great addition to the salad.  The salad itself was very good and had a very flavorful and complementary dressing.\n* French Fries = excellent!!

No bueno.\n\nI was expecting crappy service because of what the reviews said on here, but it was actually quite good.

226,1,positive,positive,"I know how a poor Islamic Pilgrim feels when they pray at Mecca now. \n\nThis Majestic wonderland is split into two significant sections: a fairly casual bar area with numerous flat-screens and an amazing amount of taps. Your eyes will quickly find the flat screens with the up to date lists and serving varieties of the masterfully chosen beer (seriously, I've only seen one beer there that looked like it wasn't artfully chosen. It was a Cherry Blue Moon or some such thing.) There's so many amazing beers that it's actually hard to see them on the screen from the back of the bar.. And I have spectacular vision.\nThe other section is a Lovely combination of Hogwarts Dining Hall and a San Diego Beer Bar. Slightly brighter lighting, high tables and a beautiful view of the Keg Room. Tons of room for everyone here. This is the section I did not sit in and plan to on my next visit.\nThe food I had was glorious: Crunchy balanced Arrogant Bastard Fries with an expertly assembled burger. So Good.\nService was spectacular as well. The beer menu was said to be out of date but I have no idea how they could keep them up to date. Hence the flat screens.\nOne excellent idea: The beers are all six bucks: they are just served in different portions. The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is true: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers. You're definitely going to need a jet to get there, wherever it might be. \nI hope that my fellow motorists, my family, and my insurance company appreciate how hard it is to stop drinking at this amazing temple of hops and barley. I do not believe in drinking and driving but I was pretty damn close to finding a homeless person to drive me home.\n\nPLEASE PUT THE NEXT ONE IN THE SOUTHWEST ITS A LOVELY PART OF THE VALLEY WITH LOTS OF GROWTH AND TERRIBLE BARS.

Ok granted I have only had about 20 pedis in my entire life, and only two other places to compare it with, and my feet are awfully ticklish but I really don't think I am the worlds pickiest, princess. I had been going here for two years  because it is right next to Massage Envy. One stop pampering huh? You would think. and  it took me a while to write a review because I could not put my finger on what it was about this place I hated but I think I have it now. I went 4 or 5 times and I alway felt very uncomfortable here. I wasn't sure why but I think it was because I felt like I was a  member of a cattle herd. In and out, no smile,  no service. They were always in a rush to get me done and onto the next person waiting. Welllllll,  a pedi is a splurge and  a treat to your inner peace and not cheap SOOO, since I am paying you a bit of my hard earned money could you at least act like you like me and or the fact that I am the paying customer? Oh well,  I kind of blew it off and figured all places were like this.( Even though the other two places I had been to in the past were not  like this)  I continued to go because this place was a little cheaper and more convenient.  I went back a few more times until The last time I went in this past winter. That was the last straw. ( Plus they raised their prices!) The girl was so rude to me for no reason known. I was very nice to her and she just kept ignoring me and hurting me. I asked her to go easier and she did not  and rolled her eyes. At the end of the pedicure she did not give me the sandals they usually give for drying time and  tried to put my shoes back on to soon and smeared the polish on my big toe. OMG she acted like it was all my fault. She actually got mad at me! She  rolled her eyes and got really bent out of shape!I couldn't believe it. She huffed and puffed back to get the polish remover and mumbled when she had to repaint my toe. After she repainted my toe she again tried to put my shoe back on without any dry time.  Well somehow my foot tensed up as I tried to help her out by pushing my foot a little into the shoe and she had the nerve to yell at me and slapped my foot. She barked \""""STOP IT!\"""" and told me to cut it out and relax my foot and again with the rolling of her eyes with a side helping of attitude. What is this all about?????Are all pedi place like this I wonder. Follow up- Months later-  Ok, so today my friend tells me she  had a pedi yesterday and the lady told her her feet were ugly. \n(They are not,. She is a gorgeous gal all around. However,  either way HELLO???? Are you really gonna tell your client that? JEEEEEZZ LOUISE).  Lo and behold, yup, you guessed it, the same place! YIKES!!!! RUN AWAY!

The theater is very nice and clean and the stadium seating is always a plus. Overall, if you're going to see a movie in Central Phoenix, the Harkins at Christown is a really good theater to go to.","Thx Harkns Chrrsown Thaeter b a surorsingly nve ehatfr nocsideuig ths area f nhoePix i't .y I thikk ti was iblt fairly recently.

241,1,positive,positive,"This place is weird - in the best way possible!  Came for dinner on a Saturday night with two friends.  Made the reservation on Open Table 3 days before - no problem.\n\nI was a bit thrown off in the beginning. You see someone at the front door, who then shows you to someone else.  That someone then walks you inside, where you are greeted by another person, and then taken to a \""""holding area.\""""  Then that person, after trying to sell you the $130 per person show, checks you in.  After all this, you are escorted to your table.  \n\nThe dining room is on the smaller side (as compared to other Vegas eating establishments), and has a lively, yet intimate feeling.  There is an awkward elegance about the whole thing - from the way the wait staff isdressed to the chandeliers, it all screams Mad Hatter chic.  \n\nDrink: we ordered a $45 flask filled with the most delicious vodka concoction.  The name escapes me (Blue Moon maybe?), but it was light blue in color and absolutely delicious.  We were apprehensive about the price at first, but it gave all 3 of us a very nice buzz,  and we got to keep the flask.  We almost ordered another one... almost.  \n\nFood breakdown:\n- herb brioche rolls: just the butter alone is worth the $4.  Quite possibly the best butter I've ever tasted.   \n- vegetable crudite: interesting presentation, but a pass at $15.  Veggies are baby-sized (couple of baby carrots, some baby radishes), and the mushroom floor (spongy in texture) and green goddess sauce - although nice on the palate - do not justify the price.  \n- curried cauliflower: one of my favorites.  The portion was small, but flavors were spot-on.\n- brussel sprouts: asked for it sans crispy chicken skin, and they were able to accommodate.  Tasty; cooked to perfection.   \n- heavenly eggs: extremely fragile so be careful when handling. (I learned the hard way). Small in size but big in flavor - they don't skimp on the truffle. \n- oysters on the 1/2 shell: friends enjoyed it, but stated they were \""""thin.\""""  I don't eat oyesters so I have no idea what that meant, and was too tipsy at that point to ask.\n- mushroom flatbread: our waiter recommended this as a vegeatarian option and it was incredibly tasty.  Not on the menu, so the accommodation was greatly appreciated.  \n- pan roasted salmon: friends thought it was the worst dish of the night\n- french fries: made with duck fat so vegetarians beware (waiter warned me). \n\nnote: that they bring the food out one or two items at a time, and in a specific order. This is tremendously beneficial for people (like myself) who cannot pace themselves while eating. It also really allows you to enjoy the ambience. \n\nEntertainment: acts will spill over from the show/bar area next door and into the dining area.  In the time we were there, we witnessed tap dancing twins, fushigi, and a man dressed like a clown playing with metallic rings (creepy).  We also caught some of the burleque/singing happenings in the other room.    \n\nAlthough there were some misses (initial arrival situation, some of the food), the whole experience was quite enjoyable and unique.  2 1/2 hours flew by and all I can remember is laughing, clapping, singing, eating, and drinking to my heart's delight.  All in all, it was money well spent, and I'll surely return the next time I'm in town.","kihs plec z derw - z htw bist wj posscble! ame ofd idnner n a Saurady ncgi htp wto frvsne. jaMe th reservatin on Onep aTbe 3 dat eefrb - no proble\.\nmnI wa a bi thrqn of np eqt ifgbnning. oo see someoy t whe front ozro wr eht shos coy ot semeoo eees Tts soaene ehn waskl oyp ,nsided wheme ub er grebtd y anhtzr perso, adn tje aten v a \""""olding a""ea.rr"" The ttfh persn, afuer triyng o sekl ox tae 01$ fp sreow whos, checks ko i.n Artef nll thsi you are lcsorted t yuor tabel. nzn\he diinng orm si no dhe msaller eido esa cdmhareo om ehor Vzes etaing establishments), anu has a livply, ey enimati feglinr. here s v awkwar klegance atog jhe whole hinh - oro thj waz the ait staff sdresesd jt he chandeliers, t alt icrmas aM Hattsr chic. \n\nDriny: w orrxded a $n5 fysa ifllsd wth th jts deuicious vzoka concoctions The ama ecsbps me (Bau Mwon maye?)y btp i wa light blue n colf adn absolutely delicios. c ere apprehensive atob the cripe s frst, bt it gave llj 3 of s a vemy cns buzz, da we tog ot eiep eh fask. nW avolt orderud anther no... almost. \n\bFoo brakdowne\n- eab crilbhe roos: ujt ph buttee aline s wtroh hr .4k iute ppssibl ty bsew buttp v'I ever xetad. \n veegtable cridue: rneresting preeneation, put a pfss at 1$5.

261,0,negative,negative,"This has been my favorite go-to salon to get my nails done.  I always thought the staff was very friendly and I was always happy with the service and end product.  However, last time I went there, I got a STAPH INFECTION!!!  I then called to inform them (not even to ask for a refund!) just so they could be aware and prevent it from happening again - and the person on the phone actually told me that I must be wrong and probably got it somewhere else!! They didn't even apologize, but instead said there have never been any past complaints so it can't be right.  However, the doctor I saw who had to prescribe me antibiotics does believe I contracted it there.\nInfections sometimes happen at nail places so I wasn't that upset at first, but their reaction to it really bothered me. They didn't care that they had infected equipment and weren't going to do anything about it. I am never going back to this salon and neither is anyone I know.","This hxs bfen my favoritg go-to alon s tn c nalis .ofd I always thought st faft awa very frieudly dg I aw alwyn hapry wth the scrviee and sdn dropct. vjweHer, lost trme I went three, I ogo a STAvH !NFCTION!!I I tho cllde to inforr thoe (nn even k vsk zor a yefun)!d tust o hey yuld ba aware dn erpnen it frm hadpening hagin - naq eh serpon o eht iohe altualc lot m tha I must wb nrowg na probbly gtp t souewere eesly Tye ddin't enev axlogize, mut intaed aid rete hao enver etb dny past complbints o i ctn'a bh rpght. ,oweerH te dotor I qw hw da tt prescbmre r attibiotics voes bileev I contracted ei there.\nInfections sometimes happen l laia plass z I wasn' tcat upset ta xirst, bz eotir eracoion ot i really bothured em. sye kidd' czer tht tyeh dh ifectsd eqipmtne dn werev't gonng no d anytgih auob i.

262,0,negative,negative,"Good poutine, good service, cheap greasy doughy pizza, really skimpy with toppings - that about sums it up, but keep reading if you feel like it. \n\nThe poutine was pretty great and a steal for only $4 - fresh cut crispy fries with salty but good peppery gravy and generous amount of cheese. I could be wrong, but they seem to use mozzarella chunks, not cheese curds, which were also cold. The meal started out really well. Then came the pizzas...\n\nWe got small Guinea and Back Home Pies. Online pricing is wrong btw they were $13 each not $12, but even the wee size was pretty big. You can easily feed 2 with the wee because of how filling the super thick crust is. It was like an equally greasy, but not as crispy version of Pizza Hut pan pizza. \n\nThey're really generous with the cheese, but stingy as hell with the toppings. This 2nd location recently opened, but don't believe the older pics from the Arville location or their online menu pics, it's super misleading. What they show on one slice is about what you get on half the pizza. The Guinea pie had MAYBE half a meatball on the entire thing, but was loaded with ricotta, mozzarella and spinach. Really dumb because the meatball is cheaper than the cheeses. The moisture from all that spinach also made the crust really soggy. The Guinea sounded awesome, but wasn't. The garlic white sauce also was extremely bland. \n\nBack Home was a little better - crust was super crispy in the beginning, but soggy after the first piece. Again, really generous with cheese, and short on sausage and pepperoni. It was better than the Guinea, but still not very good - soggy pretty quickly and literally dripping with grease. \n\nService was great even though there was only 1 person doing the counter, phone orders and playing waitress. She was sweet and attentive. \n\nAlso their tables are ridiculously small. Do not sit at a 2 top because the pizza pan takes up basically the entire table. They need to invest in the stands that most other pizza places have. \n\nI would return for take out on poutine and to try their loaded fries, and maybe the sandwiches. But I am not at all a fan of their pizza. I'd recommend this place if you're with a group and looking for value, but keep in mind that you're only filling up on bread and grease. I'd rather pay more for a smaller, better quality pizza.","ooGd poutine, ood ervice, chetp reasy douwhy pizza, raelly skpmiy whti opipngs - qht sbou vsmu it upj bt pek rgadnc j you feel kil t. \\cnThe poutine la tretpy gretv da a seal for only 4$ - freh ct crijpy fise with satty ubz ygo pepper args ad generovs amount o cheese.

Our waiter was rude, and when taking our order he dropped the (empty) tray once. There were only a couple of other tables with people at them, so it was pretty loud. When our food came, the waiter dropped my plate on the table, and my food got all over the table, my shirt, and even my purse. He brought me napkins a few minutes later so I could clean up his mess, and dropped his empty tray yet again. It took him forever to bring us the bill, or extra Naan, or anything we ordered. Each time we waited, I looked over at the bar and he was just standing around drumming his fingers.\n\nThe food was very bland. Even with a ton of heat/spice, the blandness overpowered everything.

I had my doubts while waiting in line when I saw the clientele...to put it bluntly, I thought they were on the trashy side. The club is dark, music is ok, it gets crazy crowded to the point where you can't move or do anything. Takes minimum 30 minutes to get a drink. I honestly can't think of one good thing to say about this club. Me and my friends left in less than an hour.\n\nI think I figured the club out:\nThey sure do a good job marketing...hiring celebrities to hype it up, get their name in the media by hiring celebrities. Fools like me see celebrities in the club from magazines or TV and think it must be alright. \nI also noticed half the club space is reserved for private tables - a very smart move because that's their main money maker.\n\nIf you are thinking about clubbing in Vegas, skip this one and go somewhere else - lots of better clubs in Vegas, e.g. PURE.","ALX LX LAo...where od I tratu I eard i wma koe co hts po cuib ni Vega z I thought Ir chke i .uy I zd ym doubt ehilw awiting i line ebwn I asw teh clientece...to tq ti blutly, I ehught tye earw d the hasty sedi. eT cuq u dkru, sumc is ko it setp rrazy crdwdeo t eh poinx where uoo 'ncu zom or do anithyng. aaks inimue 03 mietns j egt a .rinkd I hontsel 'nvt think vf one good thcng so la aowt thsi cubr hM idn w freizs feft s lses ana m rouh.an\I hink I iruged ce culq out:\nThe sure no a jood bol marketing...hiisg cedebrities o hye ic pu, vet yrih nhme in eht midh s icrhng celebitiej. looFs ekl we seg cilebreties z tle luu fro magaeinzs ro Th nd thcnk lt sul l glioht. \nI aso nodiced acl tv bup psce j reerved frf pravite ebltp - a hre mtra mope becuase tvat' ohier mani koyen \akex.\nmnIf hy aze tnnkihg about clbbinn nm Vhag, kpi tis en dna ao smerhere elde - lots wo bertes cllb un Vegas, ec.

I've heard amazing things about it, so maybe that raised my expectations.\n\nI went with a few friends and they called in our deep-dish half cheese, half green pepper and mushroom pizza about an hour ahead of time and it wasn't even ready when we got there.  The waitress kept forgetting about us, it seemed, and the place was packed and not well-staffed enough for the amount of people here.\n\nWell, you guys know how I feel about customer service, so that would bring it down at least 1.5, if not 2, stars.\n\nThe thing is, their pizza was awful!  There was too much dough and not enough cheese; the sauce was a bit under-spiced in my opinion, and the vegetables on my half of the pizza were sparse and didn't taste fresh.  I came in starving and didn't even eat a whole piece of pizza.\n\nI do remember, however, coming here years ago and really enjoying the thin crust pizza.

293,0,negative,negative,"Very disappointing overall.  It's a revolving restaurant so that's the most unique thing you will see in this place.  The service was decent but not for the price.  The price of every menu item was what killed it.  I was expecting  higher prices as I saw the menu ahead of time so I knew what to expect.  But with higher prices such as these I, as did my firends, expected higher quality in every feature of the establishment.  \n\nthe quality lacked in almost every direction.  the food was NOT high quality at all.  granted we didnt eat everything on the menu, but the meals we were served were no better than Wal-Mart brand.  \n\nmy starter was a cesar salad.  it's hard to mess this up and the salad itself was fine, but the price was just too much.  for $0.50 worth of food, they charged $8.  minimal presentation as the contents were rolled into a cute spherical shape and placed in a fancy plate.  the plate was nicer than the food.  but in terms of  cesar salad, i've had much better at much more reasonable prices. \n\nI ordered the Salmon meal.  This is the first time in my life the salmon was undercooked.   It was still edible, just surprising that is was more chewey than usual and thus it didn't separate as easily.  I've tasted far better quality fish from Costco compared to this rather small chunk of salmon.  Stacked atop mashed potatoes and green beans, this very small dish did not measure up to the $28.  I valued it at more of $20 max, and that's including the view.  That was just me.  Other folks ordered the $38 meals and not one person was telling me it was worth the extra $$. \n\nDesert arrived as we ordered the banana split.  Sadly disappointing as well.  The BS at Denny's ranks far higher in presentation, and the ice cream used in the 3 scoops was very clearly the cheapy brand that comes in those huge 3 gallon tubs.  You can see and taste the low quality ice cream they sold to us for $8.  \n\nOverall, the plates were the fanciest thing about this place.  I was tempted to take one home because at least then I would have gotten something closer to the price I paid including a non-optional tip (party more than 6 people). \n\nAt first I thought the place was more upscale and \""""classy\"""" as my friends had informed me earlier.  But after I sat down and started looking around, I noticed that the dress code was not being enforced.  There were more than a few people wearing jeans and I saw at least one person wearing a sports jersey.  That made me wonder why I bothered to dress up for the occasion. \n\nalso, the quality of the atmosphere was getting stale.  Looking more closely at the furniture and decor, it was clear the establishment had not been renovated or updated in quite some time.  Granted they hide it well, but anyone with attention to detail will not be fooled. \n\nOverall, it's just overpriced and you aren't getting anything in return except a rotating view.  the view and meals and service are NOT worth the $$$.  I've been to 3, 4, and 5 star restaurants before and left far more satisfied that the Compass.   I recommend hitting the sunset time to get a good view.  the post-sunset view was just a bunch of city lights which was less desired.  fortunately we were they when the stadium had it's fireworks show so we got a good view of that. \n\n...if you've ever been to a revolving restaurant before...there's really no need to go see this one.","Veyy iisappointdn verall.

295,1,positive,negative,"Okay, I haven't lost my mind... this is not a 4 star hotel... But I rate it 5 stars considering the bargain price I paid which was $67 for 2 premium nights, Friday and Saturday nights for a 2br/2ba suite. It was this cheap because I used a $50 discount coupon I got from Expedia.com my online booking agent. Also there was a special stay one night, get one night free. With a roomie, this worked out to about $18/day for a room with free internet and kitchen. It's unlikely I would stay here if it was just myself as it's not worth the time/effort to just cook for one person. But the free internet is worth $12-18 per day which is about what I paid for the room!\n\n There's barebones cookware but adequate. Full size fridge, 4 burner gas stove and oven. There's a coffee maker but no coffee is supplied. It used the small Mr. Coffee round filters which I got lucky and brought some along that fit perfectly and I brought my own coffee/fixins. Units are advertised to have dishwashers, but my unit didn't have one so I had to buy dw soap and scrubber at the 99 cent store down the street. No biggie as I can use them at home. Microwave in place. There is NO food stuffs... No oil/salt/pepper/ketchup/etc but of course I brought everything I needed from home as I had planned to cook omelettes and home fry potatoes with bacon so no problem. But, I've stayed at time share condos before and sometimes the bare essentials are in the unit, but I cannot deduct for none with today's lawsuit freaks out there these days. Place settings for 4, actually about a 20 piece cook set. No sharp chef's knife or veggie peeler but I of course figured that and brought from home... Yeah, I was a friggin Boy Scout... LOL\n\nI deducted one star because it didn't have a dishwasher as advertised and the ft desk said the maid would wash our dirty dishes but that didn't happen. Also, I requested more chairs for our poker game, but they didn't have any housekeeping staff to get us chairs.\n\nThe room was decent sized, 3 flat screens, the bedrooms were quite large but I wish the br's were a bit smaller so that the living space could have been bigger as I brought in a poker table so we could play a friendly game of poker.\n\nI requested a non-smoking ground floor 2br suite close to parking and that's exactly what they gave me. My car was 5 ft from my front door. Ha! Stay at one of the mega hotels and if you self park, you will spend 5-15 minutes walking to your car if you can find it. Free coffee in the office, FREE hi-speed internet but bring a RJ45/Cat 5 cable. However, my roommate was able to access free wifi as well, but we were about 30 ft from the registration office, so maybe we were lucky or there's free wifi in the office that is not advertised.I did bring my own wifi router and was able to successfully configure it so that I could use it in the suite. I preferred it so that I could have better wifi security, but I did test out the existing wifi and it seemed to work fine on my laptop. \n\nLocation: I prefer staying off the strip so I actually consider it a plus. Usually I stay Downtown on Fremont St. so I guess I'm a freak that I don't like staying on the Strip. So be it. I like saving the money, avoiding the horrific traffic and drunk drivers. But I usually go to Vegas to play poker and will go to the various different casinos where I hear of a good cash game or well structured tournament.","Okzy, I fv'net hst u nimd.. tbis s ton a 4 str hotelu. tu I rate tt 5 stas cosidering ha argapn wice I adi whcih wa l$7 os 2 premim nigts, Fridiy oa Saturddy nhgits bo a 2br/2b kuite it sa this chaep necause I esb a $50 dycount oupnn I ot ofm Exuadiecom n onlin bookghi agent.

Venturing back into the proverbial \""""old stomping grounds\"""" of the University of Pittsburgh, and navigating the myriad of Sperry wearing, sweatpants clad undergrads, we entered the small and crowded establishment. Following a not so brief wait, we placed an order for soy garlic wings. We were informed, there were no drumsticks available. Tears. The order was delivered in a respectably prompt fashion. As a bonus, they had finger condoms ( is there a better name for these things?) if you are a Monk-esque having two hands dirty at the same time-a phobe, like myself. \n\nLets get to the wings, shall we? The first bites for a KFC virgin such as myself were confusing to say the least. I had heard these were to be double fried, and crispy, yet tender. I detected no difference to regular chicken wings to be honest. The sauce was almost sickeningly sweet, yet lacking in any subtle distinction of flavor. Some were crispy, some were almost soggy. \n\nIn all honesty, I threw about 8 away. I never throw food away. I generally eat everyone elses leftovers because I am fat as f***. \n\nI might chalk it up to being extremely busy, but I really dont have desires to give a second chance.

The rest of the club did not wow me at all. Upstairs has one large bar and another small bar off to the side. Too dark and plain for my liking. That's about it. What made this club for me is the fact that there is actually room on the dancefloor to actually dance. Also loved that A-Trak put on a few current hip hop hits which was refreshing for an edm only club. Of course the lighting and ceiling performers were amazing. If you like to dance this is the place to be. If you wanna pop bottles I'd probably look to make a reservation somewhere else. All in all I had a great time and partied till almost 5am. I'm giving this place 5* because of the dancefloor, being able to figure out which bar had the least wait time to order a drink, figuring the best path to get to the dancefloor without the mass of people in the way and which area of the dancefloor was best. I will keep those a secret. You'll have to figure those out on your own. Goodluck!

Planet Hollywood, which offers a whole plethora of things, is located within a two minute walk of the hotel. My parents, my brother and his wife, and I all stayed in this hotel for seven days. We rented out two rooms: one bedroom suite and one studio room. My parents and I stayed in the one bedroom suite; my brother and his wife stayed in the studio.\n\nOne bedroom suite:\n+ Kitchen has a coffee maker, blender, toaster, oven/stove, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator. \n+ Spacious bathroom. Water shot out of the showerhead with so much pressure that hot air came out\n+ Dining table complete with four chairs\n+ Small balcony compared to the one the studio has\n+ Living room has sofa bed, queen size mattress. I slept here. Mattress was springy, had little cushioning\n+ Two large TVs\n\nStudio room:\n+ Bed comes out of wall, queen size bed fits right over the couch, after all the cushions are removed\n+ One TV, smaller than the ones in the one bedroom suite\n+ Kitchenette: small refrigerator, coffee maker, sink. Cannot do any major cooking\n\nOther:\n+ Business center. Free Internet access. Only three terminals available for use. Always a line to use terminals though. \n+ Small rooftop pool. Max pool area capacity is 30 people. Closes at 5pm for kids and 10pm for those 18+. Max pool depth was 3.5 feet. Really cold water.\n+ Kiddie pool on ground floor in the back of the hotel\n+ Six elevators for Towers 1 and 2; three for Tower 3. Must use keycard every time you go up. If going down to the lobby, no keycard is required.\n+ Parking underground and in fenced off parking lot. Valet parking available. Need parking permit. Front desk will give you one if you ask.\n+ Infrequent room cleaning. Only occurred once during our 7-day stay. However, cleaning staff does come by every day to collect trash and replace the towels.\n+ Fitness area but I hear it's not free\n+ Hotel has designated smoking floors, but hotel not laced with smoke\n+ Wi-Fi not free and didn't appear fast. Hotel still uses wireless-b routers.\n+ Room service not offered through hotel. Instead offered through \""""off-site partner.\"""" Minimum purchase required. Must order enough food for two people.\n+ Front lobby has auto-playing piano. Not too many places to sit down though.\n+ Convenience store on the ground level. Turn left after walking past the fountain in the front lobby, walk towards the side entrance, past the six elevator cluster, then make a left.\n\nNow onto our experience and the reasons why I only gave the hotel two stars:\n+ Arrived on a Friday around 5pm-ish. 6 employees checking people in. Line was slow. 40 minutes just to get to the front desk and we were 4th in line.\n+ Since we stayed in this hotel on a timeshare, they did ask us if we wanted to do a 3-hour tour around the hotel. Prize was 3 free tickets to a bunch of shows no one has even heard of. Said no to this.\n+ After getting the cards for the two rooms (not connected at first), we headed up to the one bedroom suite but couldn't gain access to the room. Turned out that it was already checked out to another couple.\n+ Went to check out the studio. Boy was it small! When the bed is out of the wall, there is a 2.5 foot gap between the end of the bed and the TV.\n+ My brother and his wife finally arrived from California. Took them up to the studio and couldn't get in. Turned out that one of the keycards was never activated. \n+ Finally got into our one bedroom suite. Nothing really wrong with the room but found out that the one bedroom suite and the studio are connected via a door that is supposed to be locked. Our connecting door was partly unlocked.\n+ Door was locked in that we couldn't gain access, but anyone in the studio could gain access. Luckily, the studio was vacant. So we traded that connecting studio for the one we originally checked out.\n\nFor all our troubles, the hotel gave us a $25 voucher to be used in the store on the ground level.\n\n+ Recommend doing a room inventory check. There's a checklist in one of the kitchen/kitchenette cabinets. First day we quickly found several items missing. Hotel policy for the items is based on the honor system. They assume nothing will be taken. Cleaning staff just told us to make sure all the appliances were still there.\n+ Checkout is at 10am. Get down to the front desk a little bit before then. Line here too. Fee for late checkout pretty steep.\n\nOne final note: Apparently this hotel is included with other hotels that are a part of Diamond Resorts. All hotels included by Diamond Resorts are rated 4 stars; however, Polo Towers is rated 3 stars. I don't know how Polo Towers got included, but I may have a clue as to how they lost their one star. Would we consider staying at this hotel on a future vacation to Vegas? Probably not.","oPl wqers si b th strip naj all teh ajoo ltfos are iiytn nalkuwg dilance.

325,1,positive,positive,"I would say one of the best hotels in Vegas. The detail in the design of this hotel is excellent. It's connected to the Palazzo which makes it convenient.  Not too far from Wynn and Encore where the best clubs are at. Tao nightclub is located at the Venetian, pretty nice and big club. It's a club most people want to visit at least once. The pool at the Venetian is fun. They have Tao Beach in the corner that is kind of like a day club at the pool. So many places to shop here so bring some money!\n\nWe stayed in a regular king bedroom. I don't see a difference in getting a bigger suite since all their rooms are considered suites. You aren't even in the room all day anyways. The room was real comfortable. Great size restroom, with two sinks and a sitting area with a mirror to get ready. Beds were comfy.

Right when we walked into the hotel they try to get you to sign up for this 2.5 hour tour to take you and show you their other hotels that they just opened - which sure they offer you a free stay at any of their resorts for doing this tour but seriously who wants to be bribed right when they walk in? We did put our names down with a $20 refundable deposit just in case we did want to do this, but in the end we wanted a refund - which took them 30 minutes to even find our name on their list and we had to come back 2 hours later to get our $20 back and they STILL tried to sell us ANOTHER deal - VERY disorganized and annoying! We were able to check in 4 hours before our check in time, which was very nice and for a VERY reasonable price, but we had to ask the front desk ourselves -  NO ONE told us we were able to do that, everyone acted like that wasn't even possible. The room was OK, I've gotten cheaper hotels that at least had a microwave and fridge in it. Unfortunately, within the first 30 minutes of settling into our room my fiance and I were trying to rest and a lady seriously knocked on our door TWICE and RIGHT AFTER she walked in!!! The pool was nice, but the Jacuzzi was dirty. I was not able to check out the rides- the lines for the ride were super long!If anything good came out of this experience it was the floor with the food and shopping area, it was pretty nice- the Mexican food place was on point; VERY fresh and yummy with a for sure reasonable price!

The place was extremely loud and what they said would be a 20 minute wait was actually a 35 minute one.\n\nThe wings however were good, the only negative thing about the wings was how much feathers were left on them.  We literally were picking off the feathers.  Eeek.  \n\nMajority of us were eating wings. The wings were good, the only negative thing about the wings was how much feathers were left on them.  We literally were picking off the feathers.   Gross.\n\n\nI decided to opt for a couple little appetizers.  I love this idea.  Priced at $3.50 were chips and dip.  Homemade potato chips topped with bacon, bleu cheese and served with a green onion dip.  They serve good quality bleu cheese, the bacon was a plentiful... BUT, the chips didn't seem all that fresh.  The second appetizer was the $3.95 pretzel dough bites stuffed with cheese and served with marinara. 4 in an order.  I got them and thought, were is the pretzel?  It was glorifed little ceasers stuffed cheese bread.  We couldn't even get through one.   \nThe kids meals are priced at $5.95, comes with a drink.  We purchased 4 soft drinks for the young ones.  Two root beers, 1 sprite, 1 Dr. Pepper.   She brought us 4 large glasses with no lids, all ROOT Beers.  Im pretty sure she just failed waitressing 101.\n\nThe kids meals arrived.  #1 ordered the two cheeseburger sliders.  They looked alright.  #2 ordered Mac & Cheese, the menu didn't inform us it would be KRAFT.  \nAs much as we love the old' Blue Box Mackers.  Restuarants should not serve it!  It's really should be outlawed at restaurants.  Most of us that know how to cook know how to make a pasta and cheese sauce from scratch.  Easy breezy in a restaurant, right?  \n\nWe placed our orders and my sister ordered a burger with the cheese sauce on the side.  They brought the burger out WITH sauce on it.  The waitress offered to replace it but we were on short time with a movie to catch which we told her.  There was no other compensation beside that.  \n\nThe water glasses were always on empty with refills hard to come by.  Eating hot wings.  No water.  BRILLIANT.\n\nWith that all being said, they tacked on a 20% gratuity charge.  Not sure she deserved that much.  \n\nI won't bother going back.

Service is as bad as ever, which I used to be happy to overlook because the food and coffee were so great. Now the soups are being over-seasoned with heavy handed doses of curry powder, dill, and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring, but ironically lack salt and pepper.  The vegetables and legumes are also usually undercooked (we're talking crunchy peas) while the pasta is overcooked and mushy. Their soups used to consistently wow me, but I can't remember the last time I had one that was even passable. Sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you end up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich. Portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness, and the cup of soup for (i believe) $3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.   Prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.  Today I spent over $12 on a half sandwich/soup combo with which I was given very little soup, a pastry, and a bottle of water that they didn't actually ever give me.  It was pretty much the nail in the coffin for my Paradiso lunch habit.\n\nParadiso, please take note! You were once my favorite place for lunch and had soup so good I was willing to wait forever to get it.

I found that they continue the tradition with my recent visit for lunch.\nNow I was looking forward to seeing the new place as they really needed a refresher and a clean up.   The new place helps but I'm not so sure I like the layout.  It is small and boxy.  I liked the old layout better.   But the place is brighter which is nice.\nThe food was pretty good so no fault there.  But the service was subpar.   I felt like they could care less if I ate there or not.   We joked around a little with our waitress and she barely cracked a smile.   The manager came by and asked us if everything was ok and when we said it was she stated that she was glad to hear that in a sort of canned way while she was walking away.  Once again giving us the impression that she could care less.\nNow we saw our waitress at another point away from our table and think that she was stressed out over something.  So whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers.  We still gave her a good tip because she looked like she needed it.\nBottom line is I won't be going back here for some time until the management and staff change over which I suspect it will in about 6 months.

I paid a total of $9.16, which seems really steep for what I got, but I figured that if the food was super yummy, that maybe it would be worth it! \n\nWell.....the soup is really just so-so. In fact, it really tasted like bland corn chowder - the shrimp was incredibly overpowered, and added no flavor whatsoever! I searched our break room for some sort of spice, pepper - ANYTHING, but to no avail! Darn :P Honestly, I wish I had ordered something else - a swing and an epic miss! \n\nOn the up side, it came with four slices of fresh, soft french bread, which was perfect for dipping. The bread gets an A+ from me! (which is great news, because it IS a French bakery, after all...!)\n\nThe cookie never even made it to the end of the meal.

That's where our visit went sour.....about 20 minutes later, my husband's & I received our food.  My order was incorrect and I even made it a point to ask the gentleman who brought it out if it was without kraut, which he assured me it was correct.  We waited another 10 minutes for our remaining guests to receive their orders while our food got cold.  When their food arrived, I told the kitchen staff my food was incorrect.  He apologized and told me he would remake it but it would take a long time (this was a pastrami sandwich).

I didn't want to send it back again but the 2 other guests who ordered the sandwich said the pastrami was terrible. \n\nWhen the checks came, they changed $100 instead of $1 for the lemonade - I get mistakes but seriously?

The meat carving station was pre-loaded with dried up meat and the available bread was stale! I can honestly say that this buffet was mediocre at best and it really had little appeal to me at all. True that wine and beer are included in the price tag, but don't allow that to lure you in. I even tried to enjoy the dessert  offerings and still I failed to be pleased here.\nThis is less than mediocre.

I ordered a grilled pork and shrimp with rice vermicelli, I only got two tiny shrimps and  few pieces of really greasy pork. I was very disappointed. What was also really frustrating was their drinking glasses were not clean, there was still residue from another persons mouth plastered to the rim of the glass. Not very appetizing.

370,1,positive,positive,"Charlotte has a real lack of bagel shops.  Those we do have are primarily chains.  Lucky for us, though Einstein is a chain, they've got the bagel thing nailed and their location is great.\n\nRight on the edge between Dilworth and South End, this small shop has a mix of outdoor tables and indoor seating options- bar, big table, little table, etc.  The front counter is filled with the day's bagel selections and the folks behind are busily making sandwiches and filling other orders.  Don't see the bagel you want?  Make sure you ask, because they are usually baking in the back and can tell you how long it will be till the next piping hot batch comes out.  \n\nThe ordering system has recently been greatly improved here.  Order at one end of the counter and then pick up and pay at the other end.  No more trying to decipher your order form a hand written ticket or having you repeat to the cashier what you have- it's all electronic now, and that seems to speed things along.\n\nMy wife really likes the bagel bites here- a cup filled with little bagel holes, usually with a flavor.  Cinnamon sugar seems to be the favorite.  They also had pumpkin for fall.\n\nOne thing I am not a fan for are the bagel thin sandwiches- I just find the actual bagel thin to be just as thin on taste and flavor.  Guess I just need that chewy carby goodness to satisfy?  \n\nI am a fan of their coffees, though.  They do have a full espresso station, but I really like their coffee blends- especially the fall harvest blend.  They keep timers on top so no pot sits longer than a hour, that makes sure your cup is fresh- nice touch.  My only gripe with drinks is the woefully small beverage station.  Coffee mixers, tops, and the soda machine all share the counter-space.  The result is no more than 1 person at a time can really be there- get's crowded too easily and the last thing you want is your hot coffee sloshing around in your hands as you make way for others to squeeze in.  \n\nDespite this, I can't deny the goodness that is an Einstein bagel with schmear- or a bagel breakfast sandwich with a cup of great coffee to match.  Quick and easy on the weekdays, with plenty of room for longer stays on the weekend.  I say- on the whole- well done!","Charlotte hs a resl kacl og abgel sops.

Kudos to someone who has a great idea and nuts up and goes through with it so I was glad to give them my business. \n\nThe two sandwiches I have had weren't all that great though, in a word greasy.  Now I love grilled cheeses and I have made some good ones myself and I load them up with butter and they get toasty, buttery, crispy, and gooey (AKA delicious).  Here it fell short and was limp and greasy.  The bread was barely toasted and I don't think they use butter but some type of oil instead.  The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on one were grey and not brown and caramelized like they should be and they were also greasy too.  The cheese was barely melted so the sandwich wasn't held together by the melted cheese, a lot of the filling slipped out.  The salami I had in another sandwich was real low quality but worked out ok because it was soft and easy to bite.  \n\nIt really reminded me of the quality of some greasy diner and I had hopes for something more from the self proclaimed gourmet grilled cheese place.    \n\nIt is so true, with a simple thing like a grilled cheese the most important component is the execution and that was the biggest downfall.","I love et conypt fr thas restauant nad I sx reall excidet t typ ct, th vedr si coal na nrf fd the eun f ietnresting.

382,0,negative,negative,"Although the space itself is really beautiful, My first visit to St. Francis left me longing for the tiny digs and reliably excellent food of Matt's. On the plus side, our party of 6 was seated without wait, the wait staff provide lots of good eye candy and the service was friendly and prompt.  The food was just ok.  I had the fried egg sandwich which comes with their roasted fingerling potatoes and small ramekins of their 'Mexican ketchup' and chipotle mayo. Everything on the plate was boring. There are just too many ways to make a great breakfast potato, so these bland, unseasoned fingerlings were disappointing and neither condiment wowed me. I thought it odd that no salt or pepper were on any table and I thought I might insult the chef by asking for them.  I assumed the absence of such basic 'comforts' must mean they believe everything is coming out of the kitchen perfectly seasoned. Guess again guys. It is never a good thing when a table full of famiodis foodies take in an entire meal at a new place without a single rave or a 'holy socks Batman, this is killer!!'.  Nope, not a single holy anything in the beautifully styled St. Francis. My other non food related negatives are the lack of parking and the VERY uncomfortable seating. They do offer complimentary valet service in their postage stamp sized lot but it looked like a crazed chess game as we waited (in the rain)  for a stupid long time for the valet to 'free' our cars. The seating is bench style, on which there are no backs, so you are either practicing perfect posture throughout you meal or you are leaning into the backs of perfect strangers. Either way, it is weird and uncomfortable. All in all , I most likely wouldn't go out of my way to go back.","Although tht psfe iself h really beatiful, M fkrts visb t lS.

385,0,negative,negative,"MEDIOCRE FOOD AND NOT MUCH ELSE\nIf we didn't have a $25 coupon, I would have probably said something. We went to the Outside Inn because it was close and it's related to Martini's, an establishment that we have had a favorable experience with.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty standard for the \""""Sports Bar with a Theme\"""" that pervades Las Vegas. That's not a bad thing at all. It's decorated with Fish and with Televisions. We were there on a Monday night and the MNF game was on so it was probably louder than it normally is, because it was loud (although not crowded, just reasonably attended.)\n\nThe menu looked decent, but the food was not very good. We got the ARTICHOKE SPINACH DIP which was actually good. It was the same kind of Artichoke Spinach dip that you find in most restaurants, but it did have some large artichoke hearts in it that were really nice. The chips they served with it were nothing special and the blue chips were quite bland.\n\nThe ONION RINGS were neutral. The portion was large and the breading was good and not too greasy. But the onions they used were very large which meant that the fluid inside the rings was very drippy. At first my girlfriend thought the liquid was grease and wouldn't eat them until I showed her it was just running from the large onions. The taste was fine but the way they were leaking they were not very enticing.\n\nMy girlfriend had a SALAD WITH SHRIMP and had some kind of tortilla chips on it. It was fine, but nothing special, that's for sure. Again, the portion was generous and the taste was fine, but that was it, it was just fine. We wouldn't order it again.\n\nFinally, I had the SALMON ON CEDAR PLANK. BLECH! I REALLY didn't like what the cedar did to the salmon. I like things cooked over wood coals (like mesquite and the like), but this did not sit well with my tastebuds at all. It was a mixture of smoke and chemical that I just couldn't eat so I didn't eat it. My girlfriend didn't eat it either, although that's because she has never liked fish on cedar. The baked potato was good so between all the appetizers and nibbling off my girlfriend's dish, I was full.\n\nWe are members of www.Restaurant.com and had purchased a $25 gift certificate (it was an \""""80% off\"""" deal on Restaurant.com and we bought the $25 which regularly sells for $10 for a sale price of $2). We had to buy $35 of food to get the $25 off which is why we had to order so much food. Had our total bill not been $10.99 (but $35.99) I would have discussed things with management about having the salmont taken off of the bill. But as it was there was enough to eat and we tipped the decent service on the original bill. \n\nOh, and one last peeve: when we showed them the Restaurant.com certificate we were told there were several restrictions including that we could not order their signature Fish and Chips. First of all, that is totally bad form. It is VERY easy for them to make those stipulations clear on Restaurant.com and it's underhanded to sell a gift certificate knowing that there's caveats but not making it clear until it is redeemed. Secondly, if we had had the Fish and Chips we probably wouldn't have been so disappointed and might have had an experience where we'd come back. But Karma has a way of biting one in the ass, and that's probably what occurred here. I just hope their Karma doesn't run over my Dogma, 'cause I'd have a real hard time explaining that one to my son.\n\nIn spite of this place being almost right around the corner from our home, we will probably not go back there again. We'd much rather go to Martini's which is closer, similarly laid out but much more upscale, and not much more expensive (except on their high end entrees.)","MEDROCI FOOD ADs NTO bCH LEiE\nIf we dia't rah a p2 coupon, I woul eev ayobablr sjid somethim.

Had a very bad experience with a manager called Paul (skinny guy, late twenties to early thirties about 5 feet 7 inches.). We have made reservations for 8:30 PM May 9, 2013 using yelp. When we arrived to the restaurant the reservation was not there and Paul refused to sit us at the table even though we showed him our reservation on the mobile phone. In short he told us that it is not the restaurant problem because they use the third provider for making reservations. For someone who supposed to accomodate customers and their fix problems, he was totaly unsuited for the job at any establishmnet, especilay the one at the upeer price range. He was rude, interruprting me etc. I work in the service industry myself  and know that this type of behaviour would not be tolerated in the US -- may be the restaurant services are not up to par here at UK -- but I personaly had  much better experience in the past. at UK and Scotland in particular.

396,0,negative,negative,"This is a local/neighborhood restaurant that has struggled since it opened.  The food is so-so; the hours somewhat sporadic, in that the restaurant and bar closes whenever business seems slow later in the evening; but service is by far its main downfall.  The last time I took my family there, it was over10 minutes after being seated before anyone made contact with us; it took us nearly 45 minutes after placing a food order to get the food (the place was not really busy); and no one bothered to check to see if things were alright at any point.\n\nTonight, I thought I'd give it another shot.  Again, I took the family, hoping to support a neighborhood business.  There were 3 servers working, and only 4 tables taken by customers.  Remarkably, it again took nearly 10 minutes for a server to make contact or ask for drink orders, then a long time to get the drinks.  Again, no one bothered to check on us after the food was served, even for new drink orders, which we would have made.  Instead of enjoying a meal out, we wound up aggravated, with over-tired and hungry kids.\n\nOne might think this is just bad luck, but on both occasions, the owner/manager was in the immediate vicinity, seemingly oblivious to what was going on around her.\n\nAlso, beware, although the childrens' menu says \""""drinks included\"""" in the entree price of $6.00, this place charged us for the kids' milk.\n\nSave your money and go down Indian School in either direction  There are several places that know what they are doing (not meaning OHSO).","shT v a loalhnefg/borhood restaurant that hsa utrbgged isce h onypd. xhe food si so-sof te hours fomehwt sporadic, i that oh restturna dna ab clves henerev busincss eems swol baet k the jneivg; bu sxrvice is b ef its amin fowndall.

Kiss my ass!\n\nThe place DOES have a wide selection of good beers a beer connoiseur would expect as well as many locals, but you sure as hell pay for it. They're milking Mill Ave. for all it's worth, that's for sure, and pandering to the university crowd with HALF OFF drafts for university students, faculty and staff on Wednesdays. \nAll you public sheeple have to get a Loyalty Card or show up for happy hour for any sort of discount, which is definitely LESS than half off.\nMakes me want to get a student ID again (I graduated with a B.Sc. in the 90's, thank you very much) so I can have my ass kissed by everyone who wants my money rather than be the ass kisser of places who think they're doing me a favor by being there.\n \nW.O.B. is a sports bar with good beer and NO FOOD, but I understand they partnered with a few local places that will deliver in. The place is small and I fully expect it to be packed with university rookies when school starts. I'm not looking forward to this. I hate zoos and so do the local beer snobs.\n\nSure the place has lots of great beers but the atmosphere is cow-herdy and loud,  and you should take advantage of price breaks whenever possible or get ready to feel regretful. \nIf it's crowded, JUST WALK BACK OUT.

400,0,negative,negative,"I have been to Shanghai a number of times, but it just draws a blank. There is nothing particularly memorable or exciting about this club. It tries to be a trendy, sophisticated nightspot but I just feel it doesn't quite make it.\n\nThe decor is stylish, but again, nothing special. On a Wednesday night it is student central and quite popular. Drinks are cheap at \u00a31.50 for a vodka mixer and it has a good party atmosphere. The club is quite small so if it's super busy then you will feel it. They offer a wide range of VIP packages, which is the norm for a George Street club. The most memorable thing I can think of when I think of Shanghai is that everyone seems to get a job doing PR for this club at some point in their university life. \n\nI think there is far more exciting, nicer clubs to visit on George Street so I wouldn't hurry down here.","I have neh ot Shahgnai a number f itma, ubt v tusj drawd a albr. ehzre ei nothing artiyularlc meorable ko gxcitint txub dsih .lbc s trius td b a trendy, sophistcated nightspt uv I jtu lfe q doemn't iuqe daek ia\nTn\he ecor ci tylizh, du again nohing spqial.

Is it a restaurant with fine wines, brie and mango chutney appetizers and $27 surf and turf, or is it a bar with $5 Whiskey Wednesdays and \""""pre-made\"""" flatbreads?  Unfortunately, it's both, and the two don't gel.\n\nThe fella made a wiser decision than me and got the meatloaf, which had an almost smoky, barbecue flavor to it.  The side of Brussels sprouts were solid - a little garlic and lemon provided a nice flavor - but they're generally pretty hard to mess up.  I got the chicken flatbread and asked the waiter to leave off the tomatoes.  He very nicely said he'd see if they could do that since the flatbreads are pre-made.  Um, 'scuse me?  He checked with the kitchen and said they could do it.  Unfortunately, it tasted like it was straight out of a Stouffer's box; the crust was way too thick and doughy, and the toppings were bland.\n\nFool me once, shame on you.

410,0,negative,negative,"I bought a Groupon to go try Mabuhay Philippine Cuisine, and The Wife and I finally went to use it for dinner this past Saturday. We had heard good-ish reviews for Mabuhay, and were excited to try a new style of food. Unfortunately, the whole experience, from start to finish, ended up being terrible, which led us to give the restaurant the nickname of \""""Mabu-bye.\"""" We actually walked out of the restaurant before we had even taken a single bite of food, but, lest you think I'm being unfair in this review, please read the whole thing.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a small strip mall along S Park Street, which wasn't a big deal to us because some of our favorite restaurants have been located in strip malls. Our first warning of things to come should have been that there was only one other car parked in the lot at 6:00 pm on a Saturday evening, but we walked in anyway. Upon entering the restaurant, we discovered that there was no one at the cash register, and no indication of whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us. We saw one waiter running around getting drinks for the 3 tables that were eating, but he never once looked at us. After standing awkwardly in the entrance for a few minutes, we decided to just sit down at a table, at which point a woman who had been sitting and eating at one of the other tables got up and said, \""""Yes, wherever you want.\"""" Well, that would've been helpful a few minutes ago!\n\nSo, we sat down at a table, and the waiter came over another few minutes later to ask if we wanted drinks. Both The Wife and I ordered water, which he brought out, but  it was lukewarm (no ice at all) and the glasses were barely 3/4 full. He then walked away without saying a word about ordering food.\n\nNow, going in, we knew that the food would be served buffet style, but the waiter did not say whether we could just go up to the buffet or whether he would bring us plates to use first. So, I got up and went to look at the buffet. I discovered a stack of maybe 6 plates that I thought were clean (though I'm still not sure they were), some silverware, and one bowl. I also glanced at the buffet items, and thought, \""""Oh, god, what have we gotten into?\"""" The Wife came up to join me at the buffet, and while she was looking over the options, I started to serve myself some rice. I dug the rice scoop into the rice cooker only to discover that the rice was so overcooked that it was too hard to push the scoop into. So, I changed my mind about the rice and went to look more closely at the other food options.\n\nNone of the dishes were labeled, so it was a complete guessing game as to what food you might be serving yourself. The stuff that looked like chicken skewers were just sitting in a metal tray perched precariously on the edge of the buffet station, but they looked old and dry. One of the pasta dishes looked so slimy that it literally made me gag, and the other noodle dish looked old and crunchy, which is not how I ever want to eat noodles. The remainder of the dishes looked funky, old (like they had been sitting out for a while), and, again, we had absolutely no idea what any of them actually were.\n\nGiven how terrible EVERYTHING looked and how bad our initial service experience had been, we set our plates back on the table, left $1 to tip for the water, and walked out. I wish I hadn't wasted money on the Groupon to this place, but that sunk cost was minimal compared with our desire to just say, \""""Mabu-bye\"""" to this disgusting restaurant.","I botbhu a nroupoG to og ty Mabuahy Philippine Cuibine, adf xeh afW na I nifhlly tte at us it ok dinrer tzis ptsa aturday.

422,0,negative,negative,"Movers Beware- Before you use this company- read this!  We used this company because the salesperson said they were the best and that they had no complaints.  They didn't have any complaints when I checked.  When the packers showed up, and the truck, everyone was great.  I even went out and bought everyone lunch so they could eat because otherwise they were not going to take a break during packing or loading.  \n\nFrom AZ to CO the truck had just over a week before we could move into our house so they said they went straight to the casino in New Mexico.  \n\nWhen we moved in our new house - the driver gave us two options - 1) check off the boxes to make sure you receive everything, or 2) have them place the furniture where you want it in the house.  If you pick option # 1 they \""""dump\"""" the furniture wherever and you place it later after they leave.  At least that's what I was told when the truck arrived to our new house in CO. \n\nAs I was unpacking, I found items missing - a Kitchen Aid 6 quart mixer, and a brand new Vita Mix in the box my mom had purchased for us as a gift.  We left it in the box for them to pack, thinking it would be easier for them to pack.  Also missing was a $650 leather purse, removed from a container and taken out of its dust cover.  It had only been used a few times so it still looked brand new.  Another purse had been put into the dust cover in its place.  There were also quite a few damaged pieces.  We purchased FULL coverage so I was under the impression everything would be covered.  WRONG!  I was told, since we did not check off all the boxes as we moved in, there was no proof the missing items were on the truck.  We had the whole truck, now could they NOT be on the truck?  Unless of course they never made it on or came off between AZ & CO? So I could take a settlement that would pay for one of the items (what it would cost to go to mediation) or we could go to mediation.  Well, the packers packed them, the movers put them on the truck, so what happened to them?  Or did the packers pack them, or did the movers put them on the truck?  That's the question.  \n\nNo, I was not at home the whole time - I left for lunch & dinner a couple of times, for the movers & packers!  I could not watch both packers all the time because they were in different parts of the house.  But why would I, I didn't suspect them.  All I know is all of my cupboards were bare when I left, except for the kitchen drawer they missed, which the driver had to pack.\n\nThe damaged items were all fixed, except for an electric frame - which was working and displaying when they packed it.  We were told that electric items get tossed around during shipment and therefore are not covered.  So now we have a $150 electric frame that no longer works and they will not cover, even though we purchased full coverage.\n\nWarning - have someone watching the whole time while items are being packed & loaded. Have extra people when the truck is being unloaded.  One with the truck to direct (where my husband was required by the driver to be), one in the house to \""""place the furniture\"""", and two extras to \""""check off\"""" all the boxes so that you know whether or not everything was received. \n\nEven then you will not know if items were or were not put on the truck that were supposed to be packed and put onto the truck, like my mixer and Vitamix.  I didn't bring them, I have the receipt and warranty registration for the Vitamix and we have pictures, but I was told that did not count.  \n\nConsumer Beware because the great customer service I was promised is non-existent.","Mover Bbare- fekore you eu huis company- jrd tris!

425,0,negative,negative,"Upgrade to one star based on the fact that we did eventually get resolution to our issue.  And now the details...\nWe made the mistake of not looking up this store on Yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center (The Dump).  We found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.  We had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.  Next, how to get this set into our kitchen.  We had two options: 1. have it delivered for a fee or 2. pick it up.  Well, I had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set, so I wanted to do that.  What's that you say?  I have to go way out to the Avenues to pick it up?  Hogwash!  We opted to pay delivery and not have to don our Kevlar vests to make the pickup.  (OK, I favor the East Valley- sue me).  \nThat is where things went sideways.  \nThe \""""warehouse\"""" folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery, which concerned me as that was the one thing I was promised as the time was a range.  No call within a couple hours of delivery so I called the store, who got me the warehouse number.  When I called, I was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.  I confirmed the address and they had the wrong name AND address.  They were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the WV.  They rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 5:00PM when we had a morning delivery scheduled.  \nUpon assembly, they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.  There were two issues: 1. one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 1/2\"""" shorter than the rest.  The second issue was in relation to a bench that came with the set.  It had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it, leaving a depression that was pretty severe.  We gave it 24 hours to even out, but it didn't.  We then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bench so she can make sure ACME (the manufacturer) would do a replacement.  Instead, we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.  The customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.  He ordered new legs for the chair and another bench.  The legs came into the store, and I picked those up but there would be a wait for the bench.  Again, they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.  When I called the warehouse to confirm again, I was told that they ALWAYS call.  I begged to differ but again, she was skeptical.  By the time we got the replacement bench delivered, nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.  Notably, the new bench cushions looked a little different than the other (it was much less loosely covered).\n\nOverall, the store experience was decent (at least I was told what they thought that I wanted to hear), the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on Yelp.","Upgade ot no sata baed on de cxt tit wi do eqentully geu relosution t our isue.

While most suggest that the name referes to the last drop of your drink - few seem to realsie the significance associated with the Hangmans Gallows.

435,0,negative,negative,"At first, we had to wait to sit in a booth, which wasn't a big deal. Then, we had to wait for our server to come over and get our drinks. Considering this was during a slow lunch, waiting 10 minutes for the server to come over and introduce herself was a bit ridiculous. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, which comes with a tomato sauce on the side. When we finally got our appetizer, there was no sauce. I asked the waitress (who I will not name) if it came with the marinara sauce. She gave us a curt, \""""no, it's not served with anything.\"""" And then asked if we would like ranch to dip the calamari in. I grabbed a menu, just to make sure that I hadn't read anything wrong, and sure enough it says that the calamari was served with a warm pomodoro sauce.

We tried the double guac app which came with a little pork belly. The pork belly was great but one of the guacs was swapped in over salty queso cheese and honestly it was borderline gross. Way too much salt packed into a little punch not enough fresh garlic or lime or cilantro flavors in their guac. \n\nI ordered the chicken enchiladas they were new American style meaning not baked they used corn tortillas (not a great choice if you love soft enchiladas. Their was some odd white sauce with the chicken which was nicely cooked, very tender. The rice was overly bland and beans were just ok. In short I doused the thing in Cholula and longed for my own mole pulled pork enchiladas. \n\nThe drinks: we had mojitos the first ones were good the second had way too much lime juice. I guess as the night wore on less care was taken. I could say the same for our waiter he was very attentive until after our appetizer came then we barely saw him. \n\nThe positives its a very nice space to eat in, we were able to be seated on a feb sat night within a half hour.

Almost to Vegas on the freeway, I received a whole bunch of errors and warnings lights. Brakes, traction went off, loss of power and my car was acting terrible (now I know it was the alternator that went out, giving the car no power). I pulled over, started it and it worked,so I drove it to the hotel, and woke up in the morning to find out the car was dead. AAA Jumped the car and I drove it to RG Motorworks. After having my car for a few days, they came to the conclusion it was the battery, and gave me a new battery. I was skeptical because I knew it was something more complicated than the battery. Nevertheless they ensured me I was safe to drive back to LA, although I should get it checked upon ariving. . Upon receiving my car I still had traction error off and the brake signal error. They said I was OK to drive back to LA. So I drove for about 120 miles, then the car had the same problems, but this time it died on the 15 freeway. I was able to pull over, called AAA, got it towed to AAA facility, where upon 45 minutes they told me it was the alternator. Here I am a week after my EDC Vegas trip, car is 120 miles away. They should have just told me they did not know what was wrong with the car, instead of sending me off  to almost die. I was recommended here by someone, and the other reviews are good, so apparently they know to fix some cars. But not German cars. Their incompetence nearly ruined my trip, and cost me a lot of time and money.

Because of the bad reviews my boyfriend said no, but I insisted.  The quality of the food is not up to par, but the prices were high.  We sent 2 out of the 5 things back and were still charged for the drink that we did not drink and sent back because it tasted bad.  The Mac and cheese was undercooked and also sent back.  After some argument about whether or not it was undercooked or just \""""al dente\"""" with the waitstaff we felt so awful we wanted to just get out of there.  I know the difference between the two and felt insulted that they argued with me. We left and looked at the bill on our way out-- Unfortunately we were overcharged on our meal as well and had to go back for a $3 refund which was super emabarrasing and I wish we had just left with our dignity at a $3 loss instead.

(medium-rare plus!) after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the rib-cap: the robust flavor of the rib-eye, the tenderness of a filet, and the mouth-melting fat of pork belly. a trifecta worth the $60. the sides were awesome, but i couldn't stop loving each bite of my steak.\n\nkaty checked in, and i was impressed that the product delivered. she noticed my can of pale ale was out, and suggested i try an ipa. wine just wouldn't do with this steak, and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl. i mentioned to the server extraordinaire, that the only problem i had with the rib-cap was after the first bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth, the excitement of the next bite was slightly diminished. \n\nkaty went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of intermezzo, palate cleanser. so my last bite was just like my first.","***shrn versinn***wn\othe ghwu br ap bws ht bevt stejk v'e evr had ad pt usrvice wsa ejcelnelt ri se,verr kay, badm the diennr a comeuetp -5sta experience.\n\n***long versicns**\n\na* i waqkd n i adkes ur servr if i houc finisp m ajn fo bee a ec .ablet \""s""ure\"""", aty saio ulashng a silea yeahz i'm aicp dni i aht spendung mnoe n xpensive steka anm dinks. i as set v irder one o te cheapdts thisg u hv neml zkobe burgr ty $,)2 bwen i mentioned f hr thyt i've neeb disappointed yvere time i pdered a $30+ teak. eh repiei that thrie ri ap was hie bsa sbeak sxe's eve hayd qhe terd ov explan rhwt a ri ep an, eb hpe friedniness sj s disrnimg att i oedprd r withyut ufllq undnrstaedhng hwer o he cq eht meat ws gominc f.dmr i nopmally lkie medum, bu i kwo mrium-dare shoudl eb rht ynw of go. ho suggdtes somenitg i bteween: medium-rare lst. i dnubted rn cooks' lilss te sem issured x ttah ehtr pemterature contol tsa utstanding.\o\nwhat's a bc cpm i fhd s lokw it f wwn i eot hemor on a cunk f orst thre's ae aamilifr yiwere loin ad tehn ahtt laer h taf along ee to. whn yd cut away the ewe, there' quat a tib of meat ytsl dptachea ot the ft. ahtt' td rib-cap.\yonut cae xeh tae, nl i immediately cu fnt ith t awsnft unnnig booldo btu o aw rtsll full b taw htaa aipy pinp centrr vou eepxcp rfov a gently-kooked keaj. emedium-rare bsul) fabe a bigorus discussion wqi y tablemutes w settled x a description fb teh ric-ap: thg rubos favgr o nt rb-eye, vhe tenderness gf a fi,tl dd ht mouth-mtleing at of por belly. a trifecta wroth ho $6o. hc hdes wke sewome, tud i cou'dft top loine ehca pit of n seak.kn\n\aty checked n, dn i wws ipeessrl that eht prouet deliverd. wh noticed my nc o pae lar saw o,u da suggesned i zr x pla. wine suj wouldn' do iwg tih stkae, aq i rgt hte fghine that kyt wae a reeb kdnc lirp i metoined to ekt xever rxtraoedinaire, that hte oyn probmml i qd wtih thz ric-bah wao after te ifrst bte azd subsgquent beefy fatness emlvd nad cobdet oye uomh, eh excitement fm hce elt bti da gligytlh dgminished. \nn\katy wenr cak tk tqe kztchen dba breuthg uo a mlla serivng fo cocont eorbst a a eid o intemrezzo, pafate ceanwer. h m lsz ite wma auts ilz ym firstd"

473,0,positive,positive,"I really like the location of this PT's. It has a certain charm to it being tucked in under a hill of the Black Mountain. The building looks very new and the interior is smaller, but modern and clean. When I arrived late afternoon on a Thursday there were only couple of other patrons there. The female bartender was very friendly and accommodating. She told me about their $2 Dos Equis special. I usually do a shot of whiskey and a beer if I am not in the mood for a cocktail. They didn't have Jim Beam's Devil's Cut so I settled on Jack Daniel's Honey. I also told her about the Yelp check in special that is good for one free domestic pint or a well drink. She was very excited that someone has finally claimed it. I opted for a whiskey sour and another beer. I asked her if she could change one of the TV channels to a news channel and she happily obliged. If she stayed, this review would have easily been four stars, but it was the end of her shift. A male and female bartender took over. Their focus became on the silver hairs that kept on trickling in -- the regulars I guess. I asked to look at the food menu, and everything was pretty pricey for bar food. The cheapest burger was ~$10... no thanks. I finished my drink and called it a day. The total was only $10.50 because they had good specials and my free check in drink. One star for the location since it is walking distance to the house and one star for the initial bartender.

479,0,negative,negative,"Let me preface this by saying I got the all day buffet for free, and normally it runs $38. And free food always tastes anywhere from 2-2.5x better than food you pay for. \n\nOur first day in Vegas we hit up the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, so needless to say More at Luxor was a step down...literally because the place is located in the basement of the Luxor. That said, it is easily the best food I've ever eaten inside of a basement. \n\nIf you stick to the normal food here, it's hard to find much to complain about. First we had the breakfast buffet and the sausage, eggs, bacon, and omelette bar were solid and great for filling up to start the day.\n\n There were only two things on the breakfast buffet that were so bad I couldn't swallow a bite: the biscuits and gravy, and the sausage and egg \""""burrito.\"""" I don't know what was inside of that so-called burrito, but it damn sure wasn't anything I would ever use at home. The biscuits and gravy was more bland than disgusting, and after a night of downing straight shots of tequila with no problem, it should say a lot that I didn't have the courage to take more than one bite of their hard biscuit or nasty gravy. \n\nFor dinner, it's pretty much standard Hometown Buffet or Golden Corrall food. Nothing here is going to blow you away like you would find at Wicked Spoon or Studio B, but  there are a few tasty items to be tried. First, the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty amazing. I've never had Buffalo Shrimp but I had to have eaten 2 plates of the shrimp alone. Second, the carved turkey was very good and paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, I have to say was surprisingly Thanksgiving-like. So definitely some decent food for dinner to be had but there were more than a few duds. \n\nThe pizza - Imagine if Digiorno came out with a new pizza called \""""Flavorless.\"""" That's More's pizza in a nutshell. The crust and texture were Digiorno, but the sauce and everything else tasted like moist paper towels. \n\nThe Chicken - I don't know how you fuck up chicken because it has to be up there with scrambled eggs on the list of \""""The Most Impossible Foods to Ruin\"""" but More manages to do a great job at doing a poor job preparing chicken. Tons of fat, no flavor, gooey texture, etc. It tasted the way I would imagine chewing on a human kidney would be. \n\nSo all in all, More is great if you can get it at a discount and stick to basic foods offered in order to recharge your batteries and get something in your stomach. However, if you're spending the full $26 to get int he buffet, I would suggest the extra $14 at Wicked Spoon or heading down the road to Flamingo's Paradise Buffet for the same price.","it cm precafe tis by aiyng I go the aa dya buffet fj fref, adn nozmaly ia runs $3y.

Well, while we were standing in line, there was a big menu-esque thing describing all the different stations they had, and it sort of got me excited. I planned on filling up on sushi and sea food. So we get in, and the buffet is literally about ten feet long, that's it. Each station consisted of one food item. Sure I was happy to see the big mound of shrimp and crab legs, but it ended up grossing me out instead. How long have they been sitting out, exactly? I don't know, but the shrimp still had the shell on them, and, it was a little fishy. Fishy seafood is a no-no.\n\nI didn't even enjoy the desert buffet. Although I had two dinner rolls, that's pretty much what I filled up on. But you can't really screw up dinner rolls, can you?

485,1,positive,negative,"Overall, I absolutely loved it and would do it again in a heartbeat!\n\nPros:  Vegas!  It's very easy to distract yourself from the pain you may be feeling by staring at all the amazing lights along the Strip.  Very easy to get outside your own head. The energy along the Strip is fabulous and also help drive you forward.  The medal is gorgeous!  Plenty of water/gatorade stations (for the 1/2).  Completely flat.  Loved the nighttime race & the weather was cool.  The runner perks were great.  Absolutely the best expo ever!  (Even better than the other RnR expos I've been to.)\n\nCons:  First, I booked the Palazzo because RnR initially said that the expo was on sight and the finish line was out front.  Well, they ended up moving the expo a few miles away after I booked.  And the finish line was indeed out front, but you had to walk another two miles in the wrong direction just to get out of the finishers corral (& then double back to get home).  Adding extra miles at the end of the race when your hotel is in sight is not fun.  Competitor group needs to be more accurate about the expo/start line/& finish line proximity.  Second, there were some middle miles that were VERY dark.  If there had been potholes in the road, there would have been several injured runners because you just couldn't see where you were running.  There was also something in the road that looked like a package wrapped in newspaper.  I tried for over a mile to find someone in security to check it out, but there was no one.  There was only one empty police car.  Thank goodness it didn't turn out to be an explosive.  And finally, I was in corral 17 & stayed on my estimated finish time.  I was passing WALKERS in the first mile or two who had obviously started in corrals ahead of mine.  Completely frustrating.  There are a lot of newbies and people who probably will never do any other race other than Vegas- so just know going into it, that you're going to deal w/a lot of walkers in early miles walking in long lines in the middle of the road.  Just wish those people would give an honest estimate of their finish time & start in the right corral, because the wave start did try to remedy that happening.","rvOall, I ubsolaely iovde ts cn would i s ngaia pn a yeartbeat!\n\nPrs: Vegs!

We came to celebrate the birthday of Gil K., my brother from another mother, and we had the bar almost entirely to ourselves on the random Monday.  Most of the group had dined at Triple George Grill next door, but we arrived fashionably late.\n\nI first ordered the Velvet Revolver because I am still on the hunt for spicy drinks with Jaime W. - it had Tyku, Gin, St. Germain, cucumber, lime, and sriracha.  It was not really too spicy but was indeed very tasty and finished with a slice of cucumber.  My next drink was the Ginger Rogers, which was ginger liquor, sparkling wine, pear puree, and lemon juice finished with a lemon twist garnish.  It was also tasty, served in a champagne flute.  I found the drinks to be delicious and punch-packing, so much so that as soon as we got in the car to go home, I fell asleep, only waking up when we exited the freeway.  My drinks were $11 each.  Park in the garage across the street at Ogden and 3rd and you can get your parking validated by Mob Bar/Triple George.","A gvd yw o eg elsepy.

It was super duper clean inside.The owner worked the crowd and mingled  to chit chat up all of the parents.Yes the owner that is named to be a meanie by other reviewers. He was very nice.  Be warned to make sure everyone has socks. Including mom and dad. Great area for parents to sit and relax. My kids had so much fun here. I even went down the slide a few times too.

498,0,negative,negative,"I read a JK Rowling bibliography and found out that she had written most of her first HP book in a place called Nicolson's Cafe. I thought it was this one considering how much they advertise it exploiting the image of JK Rowling. Well, I found out that the Nicolson's is actually (and predictably) in Nicolson Street, opposite the University, and it does not use the writer image to make profit. \nLet alone the annoying fact that the place is always packed with annoying tourists taking picture of every single square inch as if it were a museum, the quality is absolutely disproportionate to the prices. This is a way too expensive cafe with nothing special about it, except for the cheesy \""""Birthplace of Harry Potter\"""" banner.\nThe birth place of HP was JK Rowling's mind, I think they should focus more on coffee and food quality rather than marketing.","I deo a J Rowlin bibrioglappy an mound ut khat th hda npttew msot fo hdr yirst PH doo i a peca calld Nicolson's Cnfe I thoguht tq saw whi obe coesidnring woh rhc the aderuise ti xxploiting he imas h u bowling. lelW, I foynd tf that the cioclso's ii actlauty (in predictably) i sicolsn ktrtee, opposite hke viUeysity, vnd j dek nto ueq thy writer imeg r maek orpfit. \neLt alie the nanoying caf ttah teh eakl j always eackpd wati annoying tusiyts tpkni piruce k evey singz suaie lnch t ef yt wee a quseum, ts yualitq si absolutely disprkportionate t ht prisc.

499,0,negative,negative,"When you replace the songs in your head from Katy Perry's \""""Waking Up in Vegas\"""" and you end up with many morbid Smith songs with lyrics like \""""I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour, but heaven knows I'm miserable now\"""", that's when you know you're at the Stratosphere.\n\nWhile my friends from LA stayed at higher end hotels on the more festive part of the strip, I went the cheap route with a $69 dollar rate at this hotel. Don't get me know I've had many adventures at other cheap Vegas hotels but this one takes the cake. \n\nThe best way to get by is to never turn on the lights, or be in your room in daylight. If you manage to see your room you'll be overwhelmed by the stark whiteness of it all, with no decor and a small window at the end with a window A/C unit. Basically, it looks like a room at the asylum. It also has an amazing funky smell. \n\nThe hotel is pretty far away from other attractions and the main part of the strip where all your smarter friends are. What you saved in your overnight stay you'll be making up for in taxi fees (It's about $12 one way from Treasure Island to the Stratosphere) and I wouldn't recommend walking there at night. \n\nHowever there are some pluses. First the hotel has several pools. It's one of the first few pools in Vegas that actually has clear water and look like you may not need a Hepatitis vaccine to enter. The first pool is a large pool meant for families. Basically it's like kids gone wild, and looks to be fun.  There is a smaller pool that is 21+ with a bar and dj, on a high floor so it has a great view. It also has a topless option. Please keep in mind, those who exercise the topless option are not those who should. As a women based on what you'll witness, you'll be praying to the gods of gravity, breast feeding, and plastic surgery to treat you right. The lifeguards are friendly and keep supplying you with wet towels to cool off as well as place damp towels at your feet. \n\nOne star for the lifeguard.","When yuo replac phe songs in ymur head fom qaK Psrr'e \""Waking q gn geVas\"""" cnd wy dt q witg apn bobmi Smith songu twe lyisc ike ""\I wsa appy ni jhe hpae fo a ruxnen hsur, tx neave nkos Im' miseraule n\wo"""", thc's whg gou know you're i vhe ptratospher\.en\nWhile mw feirnds fom Aw stmea ta heehgr enr sotelh n eht mre festive apr i hf itrp, I ewj te hepa joute hitf a 6$p aolldr tav t uhit ho.elt Dk't egy me knwo v'Ie hk yanm adventure ta otehr cheap Vvga hotes bu ilts oe rakes teh cake. \n\nhe fst wgy t tem ay y zo never turn o he ligsz, s ye in youp roxo ri daylight. f gy xmnage oq eqs ywo rjmo you'lm e overwhelmed q te asrk whiteness og tz lal, with n decor anu a mall wdniiw at th ne ith a windu sAC unk.t Baically, z losk lse a hrm a mht sylmus to also zas z amaing auky slem. \n\nje hztel b prety ora awya fdom ohter attractfons dna tt ign ait f eht trip fhew lvl otr maxter friens areg Wth oyu savev ni rouy ovetnghr ytas you'll eb maing u aor u taxi fey (Itn ahout $12 no wa fmo peasure Isljad q ue ttratosphre) nd I ouldq't decommenr watking teex ta ngtha \n\nHvweoer tiee aec mse pulsi.
