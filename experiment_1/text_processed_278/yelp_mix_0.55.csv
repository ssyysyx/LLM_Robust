0,"I give this place no stars......I have been without an oven for over a week now.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER....and I can say that after working for a bank for 18 years.  Sure they sell the used appliance but what they don't tell you is that within the 30 days you find an issue they will refuse to fix it.  They schedule a repair man to come out, which by the way didn't happen on the scheduled date, because Becky has no clue where her employees are at.  He finally comes out and says it is the thermostat, couple days to order the part and he will call us.  Well the couple of days came and went and now it has been over a week and now Becky has decided to take an extended vacation and can't be reached.  My advise to Sun Cities Appliance,   Close your doors until you can live up to what your business is trying to do which is \""""selling slightly used but in work condition\"""" appliances. Stop taking advantage of the people of Sun City and return people's money since you are breaking your own contracts.  You should not offer store credit when all you do is sell crap.

1,"YC's is pretty fantastic.  You go in, pay $8 or so, and you get approximately one metric assload of food (note: metric assloads are larger than American assloads).  However, a lot of this really depends on your skill in packing as much food as possible into a fairly reasonable-sized bowl.  If you're like me and enjoy few things as much as having the blood of cute animals dripping down your chin, you should probably pack the bowl to the top (yes, I'm serious) with meat.  Don't forget to grab a few sheets of parchment paper so you can crush everything down and maximize the amount of food you get in your bowl.  Anyway, your veggies, noodles, and whatever else you want can be piled on top of the bowl o' meat.  If you do this right, your leaning tower of delicious should be roughly 3 times or so the height of the bowl.  Next time I'm at YC's I'll have to take a picture so this can be better illustrated.  Oh, and don't forget the sauces - they really make or break the meal.  If you're unsure on what kind of sauce to get, there are chalkboards all over with recipes, or the friendly YC's staff will help you figure out what you might like.  I'd *highly* recommend if you follow a sauce recipe to make double because you're going to need a lot of sauce if you filled your bowl up like I told you to.\n\nYC's is probably the best bang for your buck lunch or dinner you can get in Tempe.  Chances are good you'll end up with enough leftovers for at least another meal or two.  Just don't forget, doggie bags are 50 cents a piece, so bring some quarters or singles.","(""YwCs is wrety fantastic.

Overall, just a bad cut of meat!  We used to have a manager's special, a double bone-in rib eye for two (that they no longer have available...not to be confused with the one on the menu) that came out sizzling hot and crusty, and was to die for! They need to bring it back!  Their signature potatoes were good, but came out with the cheese already hardened and cold at the top. Tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out. When I cut into the cheese, the top separated like you'd expect with leftovers. The asparagus was very skinny and so tough I couldn't even cut through them with my steak knife. To their credit, our server was happy to replace it with green beans (which were very good).\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience, but the main attraction fell short.

0,"Do you come here often? This old line would definitely work here. Great for families or old marrieds looking to get out of the house and laugh-out-loud for a few hours. This place is a brightly colored, entertainingly, loud, home away from home, covered in unexpected but, laughtasticly humorous saying that creatively remind you of where you are.\n\nI have been here a few times in the past, with friends, unsually during the day (Day drinking, as their shirts say). So, the other Saturday night I decided to head over after some strenuous solo christmas shopping. Looking to relax, refuel, drink, flirt and..... (nevermind, it didn't happen anyways). I parked near the Greenfield side and walked up to what I thought was the main door. But, it was locked! The thought crossed my mind that they may be closed? But, the loud music led me around the corner to the chill-friendly security door check who informed me that they serve food until 2am and wished me a good time. As I made my way inside the place was pretty busy on the patio, with a live DJ, no seats left at the bar, and absolutley no one but staff on the inside, I guess that was their intention.\n\nI found a nice spot (with great viewing) on a corner table in the patio area, far too big for just myself, but who knows, the night was still young... Within seconds, my server was at my table taking my drink order and right back to take my food order (Ugh, I MUST have looked famished! Or he's just that good?) He was back over in a few minutes with my chips and salsa and appologized that the food would be taking longer than normal. I thanked him and told him it was no problem, as I was in no hurry. \n\nAs I waited I finally had a chance to really look around. I have to admit, I was quite surprised to see so many regular farmer, construction types had filled the place with their jealous polential wife types (just the feeling I got). It reminded me of my visits to the NW! I guess I'll have to make an appearance at this place more often! I felt like the best looking thing to happen to this place in awhile and I was totally cas in jeans and sneakers! It was a little surreal! Although the stinky eye lady glances in my general direction were getting a bit annoying (...remember, corner table seat.) I wanted to say: Ladies, PUHLEASE, I am NOT looking at your man! ...I am simply trying to lip read Joe Rogan's mouth for the details of the UFC fight. (the other best looking thing in the place, besides me. Yeah, it was one of THOSE nights) Sheesh! But, they would have never heard me over the DJ beats and the cornhole game happening in the walk way. \n\nJust then, my food arrived. Luckily, I had asked them to make it to go. I had read the handy yelp reviews on this Supergooeycheese chimi thingy and Man! This thing did not dissappoint! I dug right into it! Fully loaded and super flavorful! It has this amazing smelling/ tasting jalapeno cream sauce and ?lbs of cheese I asked the servicer, but I forgot (lost in the deliciousness) he smiled as he explained, knowing exactly what I was experiencing. It actually got better with every overloaded mouth full! Quarterway through I paused just long enough to realize I was already stuffed! But, by that time I was pretty much done with the discomfort of the corner seat with a 'greeat' view.\n\nOverall, a great place to take the fam to get out of the house for a nightlife atmosphere with generous sized portions of food and not have to dirty your own kitchen. Buuut, not the best place to go for a 'meeting' or a friendly conversation with strangers.","(""z you me heoc ofes? This old line would definitewlyu woyr here.

0,"Well after a few months since my previous review I did return and things have not changed one bit. The silver age, war and horror (old school subjects, from the 60s/70s) drawers are still empty. I collect silver age, but I don't have a specific item that I am looking for, I basically browse the drawers and if a cover appeals to me I buy it. To me not having a structure in my collecting makes it more fun, I don't need to complete a full run and any random book or subject is just fine with me. The cover art is what I am mostly looking for (since 90% of the time the story in the book lets you down in relation to the exciting cover art). I really liked it when they had several drawers full of silver age that I could concentrate on and they were located in one place towards the beginning of the line of drawers. Now you can find silver age, but they are mixed into all the other hundreds of subjects and those drawers are so full you can't even look through them without removing a huge stack so you can take a look. Some drawers are so tight, you can't even remove some to make room, other drawers are packed so loose that the books are falling over damaging other books and folding them.\nI did manage to find a few items that totalled about $15, but when I checked out, again no mention of the rewards program.

0,"I really wanted to like this place as I live just down the street.  I am reviewing dinner here, in the dining room.  Soup of the day--some sort of tomato and pasta soup.  The pasta was beyond mush, not edible.  I got the pecan crusted salmon with sauteed spinach and red potatoes.  The salmon was abnormally fishy--perhaps not the freshest?  But the pecan crust and balsamic drizzle were tasty.  The spinach was sauteed in (what seemed like) the equivalent of an entire tub of margarine.  I had to put a paper drink napkin under the spinach to try to soak up some of the margarine...a completely drenched napkin later, I sill had margarine spinach.  For the cost of the amount of margarine used they could have used a teaspoon of REAL butter.  The red potatoes I was expecting were home fries (breakfast potatoes).  My husband's Cajun chicken sandwich was as he described, they driest sandwich he'd ever eaten.  The potato salad that came with the sandwich was amazing, however.  For dessert, creme brulee, which the menu indicated as a restaurant favorite.  Hmm, it was more eggy than creme brulee should be, and was left unfinished--a rare occurrence in our history of encounters with this tasty dessert!  The service was also very slow and inconsistent.

She checked on me throughout, and even went so far as to offer me a soda refill to go as she presented the check. Now that's a nice extra touch.\n\nThe food selection is not huge. This is more of a place for simple and fresh than complex and overwhelming. Sandwiches, salads, a few fish items (I don't know why this was listed under \""""seafood\"""" on Yelp), and a beer & wine list round out the menu. Cocktails can be ordered from the nearby pool bar if you're willing to wait a few moments.\n\nI had a tough choice deciding between the Chicken Caesar Salad and the Ground Steak Burger, but went with the burger (there's a shock). The meat was juicy and tender, and the bun nice and soft. Toppings were fresh and crisp, and instead of dropping a bunch of squeeze bottles on the table, they served good portions of mayo, mustard, and ketchup in their own individual ramekins.\n\nI LOVE RAMEKINS.\n\nI even love saying the word \""""ramekins.\"""" Definitely a classy touch there.\n\nI really wanted to try the fried clams, but as I was on a solo culinary adventure, I couldn't justify the piggyness. I would have liked it too if they had a dessert menu. Maybe a nice lemon meringue pie, or lime sherbet. Maybe a strawberry kiwi tart. I do love tarts. (Insert joke here.)\n\nThe only downfall is the price. After a burger, fries that had a hint of parmesean, and a soda, I was up around $17. Gack. That's not what I would expect to pay at a beachside cafe. That's when I realized, oh yeah, Santa Barbara, not Oxnard. So that is what it is.\n\nOverall this place would have received a solid 3 star rating, but the service kicked it up a star. It probably won't fall into the \""""regular hangout\"""" arena (unless you're part of the Nouveau Douche who parties all night on their parents' credit card, wake up at the crack of noon and roll out for the first meal of the day at 2pm), but for a nice bite for lunch now and then it's a great option.\n\nPS: Gotta put out the full disclosure here: I work at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where Overlook Grill is located. However, as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees, I have been honest in this review.

0,"I wanted to lovvvvve my stay here. I  booked 4 rooms with the most fantastic person in the world, the manager Louise, and everything went off without a hitch. The staff here is decent (except the shuttle bus driver...but I'll get to that). The hotel itself is clean and quiet for the most part, so if you're just looking for a place to sleep, you'll be happy. \n\nLet's start off with my least favorite person/people on the trip...The shuttle bus driver. The man does NOTHING all day. We were in a group of 8 and we asked for a shuttle ride 3 times and were denied 3 times. The first time, 2 people flew into the airport and needed a ride to the hotel, they called the hotel and they said that \""""he didn't show up for work\"""" but if they took a cab, they would be reimbursed. Well, that was nice and much appreciated by them. The second time we tried to utilize the shuttle was to take us to Hohokam, but the shuttle bus driver said he \""""might be to busy to take us\"""". Ummm, isn't that your job? I mean, to take people places. I was promised by the hotel that you would take us there...but you're too busy to do your job? That's cool...why don't you just keep sitting there eating breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to that...). The third time we needed to use the shuttle was to take 2 people to the airport the night that they were flying out. We called down to arrange and again were told that the driver didn't show up. Wow. Fire him! The whole 6 days we stayed there, I saw the shuttle van move one time. ONCE!!! \n\nNext up, breakfast. Anywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Us baseball fans will pack your hotel, as a matter of face it will probably be at  100% capacity during March. If you offer breakfast, have enough food. Every single day, our hotel ran out of certain things. Little milk cartons, biscuits (they had gravy...the breakfast lady told me to use regular bread. haha. asshole), cinnamon rolls, bananas, pancake batter, sausage, bacon, eggs, etc. Those are just a few of the things they kept running out of while I was there for 6 days. One thing I noticed that the shuttle bus driver actually did well was (and probably what kept him SO busy) eat breakfast all morning. Yup, the same stuff that they were running out of, was being chowed down by the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person who just takes advantage of stuff. He's useless. \n\nThe pool at the hotel is small and doesn't look like it was cleaned in ages. I'm sure it was, but seriously I wouldn't even dip my toe in there, that's how disgusted I was. \n\nI booked 4 King rooms, but we only got 2 king rooms. The other two were queen rooms. Again, very disappointed that we all didn't get the rooms that were originally booked.  \n\nUmmm yeah... Sadly I won't be staying here again. Besides Louise, everything was a huge fail in my book.","('I wanted tl lovvvvve k stq re. p boekd yh soomsm weit the mowt fantastic upersaon p the wordm, the managek Louiseap aknx everything went eofi aithout aj hitc The stcafnf hnbre kis delnt x(ecept the shute bubqs river...out \'ul get yo othat) The hotz xitsef x clean dd qeuziet for we most part, ro if yjoure jns lookhink fohrg a place to sleep, you\'ll je hmxappy. \\n\\nLet\'s sdtirt ofafv kih nmn least favorite person/people ono wtpe trip..v.Thz shuttle bus rive.

0,"My husband and I stood at the Luxor from 13th to 16th of June and will not be back. \n\nOur room was in the pyramid, 20th floor. First bad thing about is that the elevators are in one corner of the pyramid and if your room is not close to the elevator, get ready to walk! In the pyramid there are no windows, so the air is not really good, A/C must run all day long. In our room, the dust was all over, when I realized it was way too late to call the housekeeping people and I was way too tired after traveling from LA to Vegas and spending the day walking around like crazy. \n\nI decided to clean a bit around my bed with a wet towel and notice that the fire sprinkler by the bedside had about  1/2 inch of dust, it seems that nobody looks up when cleaning, plus the headboard, lamps and nightstands had a lot of dust. After cleaning and seeing the white towel become nasty, I decided to hang it in the bathroom, in the vent that was also nasty with dust, to call for the housekeeping attention.\n\nTo my surprise, when I returned to my room later in the second day, the towel was still hanging in the vent and the dust was still there. I took a picture and sent to the hotel management, from whom I did not hear back until now. I know how hotels work, instead of resolving the problem; they try to please you giving another room, so I did not go to the front desk. Resuming, the dirty towel stood there until my check out. I showed to the front desk attendant my picture and she was nice to cancel the resort fees and apologized, which was nice of her, but still did not make me change my mind.\n\nOverall, the Luxor has seen better days, the pyramid is dirty and in need of attention inside and out, from my floor you could see those \""""buildings\"""" they have put as decoration in the middle of the pyramid and on the top of them the amount of empty cans, cigarette packs, and litter is ridiculous. Clearly there is no attention to maintenance, cleaning and guests well being.\n \nOther hardship I had , we went there to meet a friend who was staying also at the Luxor coming from Brazil (so he had no local cell phone). Nobody could find him by his name, I tried the front desk person and by phone. They do not show much good will in helping you. I had to find my ways using contacts in Brazil and everything was good. I could later contact him from my room just dialing his room number. When I did my check out and left to Excalibur's buffet, I called Luxor to speak with my friend and asked for his room number. The operator said that it was an invalid room number... WHAT????? Not only I had been there but also called many times from my room!!!! She asked for his name, I spelled last and first name and she said that he was not at the hotel... WTH?? \n\nAgain????????? I got REALLY mad and decided just walk back there to meet him, since the lack of interest of those people in helping is just ridiculous! \n\nResuming, the casino is ok, the restaurants are ok, front desk staff is very nice and friendly, operators sucks, and the prices are ok, but honestly, I rater pay a bit more and go somewhere else next time.","('My husjnd and xx stood at tef julor fgrobm 13th pto 16th t yJunne and wl dnot bd back. \\\\nOkr room fs in the pyramidjp, 20th fflooe. girse bah nthig bozut tsr thpat the eleator r in one corner of the epramid and if your roaj iz ntt cloucse tr hde elevator, get ready to waltz n the pyrlamcd thekse r no winyows, v the ayic sx not lreahly good, A/C usvt run lg day long.

I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.\n\nEllis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.\n\nEllis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.\n\nEllis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your \""""center cut sirloin\"""" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into \""""steaks.\""""\n\nBut, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.\n\nI arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a \""""steak\"""" dinner. We were unenthusiastically \""""greeted\"""" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.\n\nAfter a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, \""""Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?\"""" He got even closer to me and yelled, \""""No!\"""" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, \""""Don't threaten me!\"""" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.\n\nAmazing! I have never had an experience like this.

This was 1pm on Monday after the new year mind you.  Then I say I will have the steak sliders, nope out of those too.  Finally settle on Fish and Chips which were ok.  The fish was fresh but was not seasoned at all.  Chips were bag frozen so not much to expect.  Apparently the kitchen was shut down later due to lack running out of food and the place was actually turning away business.  The service was ok but really had to make up for the lack of the kitchens ability.\n\nThis is a bar and should probably stay away from serving food at all.

Santa came early that year... but in a good way. It truly doesn't get much better than this.\n\nThe service is impeccable. Without being unctuous. As some service in fine dining can be.

Just that good. Is that tarragon? I don't even care. Just stand back. Because nobody comes between me and my shellfish. I'm just selfish that way. Then a scampi dish that I would knock my grandmother over to enjoy. We had a French version of risotto that was superlative. It was a cross between bouillabaisse and risotto. Rock me chef. Just rock me. It had langoustines.\n\nWe shared bubbly, and a few half bottles of wine that our great server suggested... boss isn't fond of sommeliers. He had an experience with one that was bad.

0,"I really wanted to like this place.  I consider myself somewhat of a cupcake connoisseur.  Every time I visit a new place that has a cupcake bakery, I try my best to visit it and try a few.  I'm also a home baker, and I make a mean cupcake.  To put it plainly, I know what cupcakes should taste like.\n\nUnfortunately, they should not taste like the stuff that Cake Cafe puts out.  We stopped by one day after seeing a sign on a sidewalk with balloons attached.  After debating for about two seconds over getting cupcakes, we pulled into the parking lot.  Walking in was not a pleasant experience.  The decor reminds me of a twelve year old pre-pubescent girl.  Not a good thing.  There are way too many non-cupcake related cheap gifts cluttering the right side of the decent sized bakery.  \n\nI ordered a peanut butter chocolate cupcake, my usual, and the husband ordered a chocolate mint cupcake.  My chocolate cake was dry and tasted off.  Other reviewers suggest that this is because they used cake mix, and I have to agree. That's probably it. The frosting however, I liked because it was super sweet and peanut buttery. The grainy texture was a little irritating, but the flavor was still good. Opponents of super sweet will not enjoy these. The husband also had a chocolate cake and the accompanying \""""off\"""" taste. He also wasn't sure if the mint was in the cake as well as in the frosting. He enjoyed the frosting but remembered the far superior cupcakes we had enjoyed at Yummy Cupcakes in California previously.\n\nI may go back here.

Let us try everything we wanted and helped place our orders like a champ... But that's where the good times stopped. We took our order to go... It was a mistake.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken and white rice. Her bowl was put together sloppily and had little sauce to flavor the bland unseasoned chicken. The rice wasn't even warm when we made it the two blocks back to our apartment.\n\nI ordered a large or two meat bowl... I asked for the Jen Red pork and Pollo Diablo with pork fried rice and black beans. I didn't get any pork... Neither the Jen Red nor in the fried rice. I think I got the pollo diablo chicken, but it was mostly chopped green onion, loads of garlic, pepper seeds, and enough oil to leave a couple tablespoons in the bowl when all else was removed. There was also a cheese quesadilla in the bowl that I didn't order... There seemed to be twice as much white rice in my girlfriend's single bowl as I was given (on top of getting meatless pork fried rice). The half of the quesadilla that wasn't dripping in oil was good, according to my girlfriend... \n\nI ate most of what I was given, though my girlfriend told me it was a bad idea... She was right. I ended up with indigestion the likes of which I haven't experienced before. For the next 12-16 hours I was afraid I'd gotten food poisoning. After taking two zantac 150s, three alkaseltzer, and a handful of tums, I was able to sleep... Then awoke two or three times to rush to the bathroom.\n\nI know it was only our first time...

1,"\""""The original sports bar and restaurant\""""? If by \""""original\"""" you mean old, this sports bar fits the bill. Located in a nondescript part of town off the strip, we weren't sure until we actually walked through the door whether this spot was actually still in business. Once we entered, we were confronted with a rather uncomely and smoky bar area; taking our chances, we proceeded to walk through a narrow passageway that opened into a back seating area with tables and booths. Very quiet. Strange layout, I must say.\n\nBeer is cheap (e.g. Shiner Bock for $2.50). We happened to come in during a game, so pizzas were half off. However, we wanted to try the famous STROMBOLI, so we ordered a small original one to share ($8.49). It was pretty good! I was expecting something dry and tasteless, but the dough was soft, crisp, and perfectly baked. CHICKEN WINGS ($3.55) were cheap and decent.\n\nOverall, having had low expectations for this dive bar, we were quite satisfied. There was an elderly couple across the room who ordered a large pizza (remember, it was 50% off). I think they only ate one piece between the two of them and packed up the rest to go. Smart idea if you don't want to cook dinner! The booth behind us consisted of a middle aged woman and her elderly mother: they enthusiastically ordered a TABLE FULL of dishes as if they were a gang of college jocks. I just saw the waitress bring them dish after dish. I think it was the mother's birthday or something. Or maybe just the daughter's annual visit. In any case, as we left, satisfied with our snack, we were somehow cheered and warmed by the memory of two grown women pigging out on some good ol' comfort food.","('\\""""Tyae origna snyrts brl d restaurant\\""""?

0,"After arriving in Charlotte, I went to the Avis counter within the airport to rent a car.  This is the first time I've rented in Charlotte and the first time I've rented any car in over 10 years.  So I'm a little out of touch.  After waiting 10 minutes to talk to the one clerk, she told me to get on the bus and go to the Avis rental car center.  So I got on the bus and went to the rental car center.  \n\nWhen I exited the bus with my bags, there was a friendly, smiling woman who asked me for my last name.

I walked to the car with my two co-workers thinking, \""""I should've asked for a bigger car.\""""  \n\nUpon arrival, I saw that we had a Chevy Cruze, which is small for three people to spend the next three days in.  But I didn't ask for a different car because we were in a hurry to get to the office.  They charge $5/day for GPS, so I brought my own Garmin, which worked out perfectly.  When we loaded our luggage and sat in the car, it was quickly evident that this was formerly a smoker car.  What happened to the 'Smoke-free fleet', Avis?  The car smelled pretty bad, but we took it anyway.  As I was driving, I thought, \""""Oh no, they're going to charge ME for the cleaning of the smoke when I return the car!\""""  So I called Avis and explained that they gave me a smoker car and I had better not be charged for it.  The phone representative noted this on my account and I was never charged for the cleaning.  \n\nStill, it was a disappointing experience because cigarette smoke is my pet peeve.  I hate it and I do not want to be exposed to it.  Ever.\n\nThis was a learning experience.

0,"So once every few years I think to myself \""""hey maybe I should go to a cheap Chinese buffet\"""" and then more often than not I regret my decision. This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.","('So ojce every few years qt thk to myseeef \\""jhey yaybn I should go oc ee hep Chinese buffet\\"""" and he more often than not ei reoretk my decision.

0,"I am done with the Armitage. I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced, the food and service was always good. \n\nA couple of months ago, we went there for a birthday lunch. I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita. How can one mess up a veggie sandwich? How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up. Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments, especially since I wasn't the one paying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday. I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare. When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky, the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo. I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender, on the medium rare side. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said \""""that's how it's made.\"""" I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits. No comment from the server. I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid. My partner's \""""medium-well\"""" burger was very well done. She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain, do we? We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed, since we didn't see him until the end of the meal. At that point, we made it clear that we were very disappointed, and showed him the doneness of the burger. I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp. We settled on a free dessert. He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture. Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time... \n\nTo the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before, and that there is now something wrong, have your people pay attention. Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen. However, based on what your staff said, IF it is now your intention to provide an overdone dried out sliced sirloin sandwich, and  to overcook burgers regardless of the order, then you have no business in the food business. If not, then you better get in that kitchen and fix it, because this sort of news travels fast in my community. \n\nIn my book, two strikes and you are out.

I cruised through the NoDa area and when I saw Cabo I recalled the decent Yelp! reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  I went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy (the rest of NoDa was a ghost town) and the service was prompt and friendly.  I ordered the jalapeno & cheese 'mashers' which I presupposed meant mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, I was giving the beans and rice, kind of a downer as my GF ordered the beans and rice and we wouldn't get to see what both sides were like.  In the server's defense, she did ask a moment after bringing it out if everything came out right.  I enjoyed everything else enough to just overlook the error.  The chips and salsa were good and, as this was my first time here, came as a bit of a pleasant surprise.  Price-wise I think it was about what I expected $22 for two meals w/ water and tax+tip.

0,"So, I used to think this place was reasonable.  Being from California, I've missed good Mexican food so much that I sometimes find myself saying things like, \""""Maybe Chipotle really isn't that bad...\"""" or things like that.  And for a while, Cuzamil kept me from tearing my hair out when all I wanted was some greasy, hole in the wall Mexican food.  Cuz when I say I want Mexican, that's what I want - not the fresh ingredient gourmet stuff that they serve at Cantina, but the greasy spoon stuff that is dirt cheap and is essentially what you are craving after a good night out on the town.

I ordered the enchiladas especiales, which were supposed to come with avocado salad (which is really the only reason I got it).  What I got were two enchiladas that were gooey, tasteless, the tortilla was chewy and clearly stale... and no avocado salad.  I asked about it, and the server came back and said they didn't have any avocado.  So... lemme get this straight.  You don't have a major ingredient, and you're not going to ask the patron if they want to change their order?  AND you're going to charge them as though they got the entree they wanted, rather than two lifeless enchiladas, which are much cheaper?

0,"SAD! So much potential, but missed it completely. Many times, when I first drive up to a place and I see 3 or more of the staff outside the back door smoking cigarettes I will hop back in my car and leave, but this place had really good write ups and we were in the mood for some super Italian food after working all day so we decided to give it a try anyway. We were readily greeted and seated, and water was brought to the table in no time at all. We had a few minutes to look over the menu. My husband and I decided we would each get a salad and then share an entree of linguine with clam sauce. I ordered the mixed green salad which was supposed to have greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives. I kid you not, there was only about one fourth of ONE olive on my whole salad and there was no onion whatsoever. There were greens, tomatoes and three half slices of cucumber with a tasty balsamic dressing for $8. What it should have cost was $4 at the most. My husband ordered the arugula salad topped with Gorgonzola cheese. The arugula greens were nice and fresh and the he enjoyed the balsamic dressing as well BUT his salad only had a minuscule amount of Gorgonzola on it ( three small pieces to be exact) $9  I must give credit where credit is due, their bread was really quite good. It was a flat bread that seemed freshly baked right out of their wood fired oven and then lightly brushed with olive oil and dusted with black pepper. Then linguine comes out. First thing I notice is there is no spoon served with the pasta dish. Well, I figured out real soon why there was no spoon because there was NO SAUCE (unless a tablespoon of sauce counts) also, about one third of the clam shells that were served with the pasta were void of any clams. One of the clams was still shut too. So, the tablespoon of sauce we did get was tasty, but really...how hard is it to add a bit of garlic, butter and white wine and put it on the pasta....there was no sauce! The whole meal was so sad because components of it were so good but then it was so messed up by the huge oversights. The homemade pasta noodles had delightful flavor yet so very very dry. I wanted to try the tiramisu for desert but by this point I knew what to expect so we passed. So very very sad. Bummer! It seemed like a restaurant that was skimping on everything because they were struggling not to go out of business.

Key words: fresh bread, fresh seafood, foie gras, and TRUFFLES!!\n\nStarted with that amazing bread they bring out baked fresh onsite that reminds you of daily breakfast strolling the streets of Paris. Crusty on outside and chewy soft inside. Rub that housemate butter and dijon mustard. Yes!\n\nNext we shared an assortment of the oysters available. Fuck the freshness is so damn good. Yes, you pay for them here and yes it's the same anywhere else but I love it when it's fresh.\n\nNext had the escargot and crispy duck leg. Escargot is wonderful because of all the butter. What was a nice touch was the pastry baked on top. Loved it. Crispy duck leg was too salty and didn't enjoy it. Would have been really good based on how it was cooked but just added to much salt to it. \n\nSome Pinot Noir to wash it down and get ready for what's next. \n\nPan seared Foie Gras. Woo Hoo.

0,"Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations. \n\nFirst impressions are not everything. Make no mistake, the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises, all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit), employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!\n \nUnfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all, or maybe it is, just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun, pickle, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home, they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal. \n\nSome people will gawk at my review and say \""""Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind.\"""" And to that I say \""""My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy. I took one bite and found myself only pushed further to disgust by this rip off of an establishment.\"""" \n\nWhat a waste of time and money. I think it's safe to say Portillo's failed to gain a regular customer yesterday. I also think it's safe to say I won't be recommending this pace to anyone any time soon. \n\nThe only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the \""""American Dream\"""" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food...

Let's start with the salad which was ok but nothing special to say the least.

As you can see, it hasn't...\n\nWe arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \""""Golden brown\"""" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \""""yes.\""""  I placed a late order of that, as well.  \n\nWhile the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!\n\nAlso, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(\n\n*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days...","('12/03/12\\n\\nHmm... k could\'ve sworn hIx had wittn a zview of hii pacej beforel. tb the mer lst, i uploaded a ce pics f unr breakfast aqere many months agouc Totk my Mom uoq tiyq thpe oven-baked pancakes rne. pDo yourskl j favor and pazs on these!
